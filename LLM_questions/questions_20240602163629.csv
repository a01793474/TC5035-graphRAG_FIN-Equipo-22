What factors influence the availability of third-party software applications and services for Apple's products?,"The availability of third-party software applications and services for Apple's products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for Apple's products compared to competitors' platforms."

When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for Apple's devices can suffer."
What is the impact of third-party developers being unable to keep up with the pace of change in Apple's products and operating systems?,"When third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with the pace of change in Apple's products and operating systems, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for Apple's products."
