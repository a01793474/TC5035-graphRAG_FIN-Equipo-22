distributionthe company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets the company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force the company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers during 2023, the company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net salescompetitionthe markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual propertyapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 2the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services principal competitive factors important to the company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputationthe company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases in addition, some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss the company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offersupply of componentsalthough most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories therefore, many components used by the company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuationsthe company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirementsthe company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at allresearch and developmentbecause the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“r&d”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technologyintellectual propertythe company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services this includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the us and various foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnelthe company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world over time, the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products and services the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and servicesin addition to company-owned intellectual property, many of the company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company’s products, processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at allapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 3business seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introductionhuman capitalthe company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive

materially and adversely affectedbecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods this discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statementsthis section should be read in conjunction with part ii, item 7, “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in part ii, item 8, “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10-kmacroeconomic and industry risksthe company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial conditionthe company has international operations with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales in addition, the company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the us as a result, the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditionsadverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services in addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factorsin addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvencyadverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the company’s financial instruments these and other impacts can materially adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock pricethe company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptionspolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partnersapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 5the company has a large, global business with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales, and the company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in china mainland, india, japan, south korea, taiwan and vietnam restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the company’s operations and supply chain and limit the company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers the impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations restrictive measures can require the company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms changing the company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the company’s operations such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures for example, tensions between governments, including the us and china, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the company’s business if disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the company’s business political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the company’s businessmany of the company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the company’s control global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events can make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas following an interruption to its business, the company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the companythe company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the company’s business, and harm to the company’s reputation major public health issues, including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new serviceswhile the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may ariseglobal markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these marketsthe company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businessesthe company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services as a result, the company must make significant investments in r&d there can be no assurance these investments will

patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights in contrast, many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the company operates if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property, the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affectedthe company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships in addition, some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources, experience or

overalladditionally, the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutionsthe company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applicationsthe company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectivelybusiness risksto remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and servicesdue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and servicesthe company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the ussubstantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in china mainland, india, japan, south korea, taiwan and vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations changes or additions to the company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial conditionapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 7the company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the us, asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputesthe company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impactedfuture operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable termsbecause the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition for example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all such disruptions could occur in the future while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers, described in “the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can also affect the company’s ability to obtain components therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial conditionthe company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements when the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative sourcethe company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company’s business and result in harm to the company’s reputationthe company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health in addition, the company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors as a result, from time to time the company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company’s products and services in addition, the company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company’s products and services, and result in harm to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost salesapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 8the company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation riskthe company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competesthe company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitmentsthe company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at allthe company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties in addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time, the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice, the company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s business, results of operations and financial conditionthe company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developersthe company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services there can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the company’s productsthe company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as android for smartphones and tablets, windows for personal computers and tablets, and playstation, nintendo and xbox for gaming platforms this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and servicesthe company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share when developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices can sufferthe company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the company’s productsapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 9the company distributes third-party applications for its products through the app store for the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store the company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application from time to time, the company has made changes to its app store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements the company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the app store, such as the european union (“eu”) digital markets act, which the company is required to comply with by march 2024 the company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the app store, which have resulted in changes to the company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms future changes could also affect what the company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the app store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms this could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the company earns on those sales, would decrease if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affectedfailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business, results of operations and financial conditionthe company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the company’s own services the licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rulesthe company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the company’s customerssome third-party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there can be no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely mannerthe company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culturemuch of the company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in silicon valley, where most of the company’s key personnel are located in addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving if the company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibilitythe company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success if the company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial conditionthe company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellersthe company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors the company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales forcesome carriers providing cellular network service for the company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device there can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amountsapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 10the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays these programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s productsthe company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptionsthe company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions system upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products these events could materially adversely affect the company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial conditionlosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequencesthe company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the company’s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial conditionthe company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties the company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial conditionthe company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis these attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the company globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents in addition, attacks against the company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflictalthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processesthe company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities for example, third parties can fraudulently induce the company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the company’s or its vendors’ systems and services to help protect customers and the company, the company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and serviceswhile the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may ariseapple inc | 2023 form 10-k | 11investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s

various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future in addition, agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party the number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increasethe company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks for example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several us jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damagesregardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the company’s operations in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements can also significantly increase the company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the company to change its business practices and limit the company’s ability

distribution channels for example, the gross margins on the company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time the company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the company’s services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures these and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial conditionthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses further, the company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partnersthe company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar relative to local currenciesthe company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–us dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuationsthe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the us dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated salesconversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar, while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus

control of the products or services is transferred to its customers control is generally transferred when the company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers for most of the company’s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped for the company’s services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicablethe company records reductions to products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the company’s expectations and historical experiencefor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“ssps”) when available, the company uses observable prices to determine ssps when observable prices are not available, ssps are established that reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis the company’s process for estimating ssps without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligationthe company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone, mac, ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include icloud®, siri® and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative ssps because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the company’s estimated ssps revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be providedfor certain long-term service arrangements, the company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered for these arrangements, the company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services the company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services accordingly, the company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered servicesfor the sale of third-party products where the company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers the company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product for third-party applications sold through the app store, the company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer therefore, the company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in services net sales
