Truist Managing Director of Energy Research Neal Dingmann joins The Morning Brief to give insight into the energy sector and what investors can expect from Exxon and Chevron moving forward. Dingmann explains that growth will be accelerated by two upcoming projects in particular: \"They're going to have big growth...in Guyana and the Permian [Basin]. That's going to keep the remainder of their overall portfolio flat. Guyana is the one worth pointing out. If you look at the projects coming on through 2027 on a gross basis, which Exxon has 45% of this, that could do almost 1.2 billion barrels a day. You think that: the US alone is doing about 13 billion barrels. This is encroaching on over 10% of what the US alone could do with this project by 2027. That's why it's obviously a big deal on this litigation between Chevron and Exxon on the Hess deal. I cannot say enough about this Ghana project...It's a mega project to say the least. \" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Glickman emphasizes that investors looking to capitalize on the energy sector should first consider their outlook for crude oil prices. He believes that with crude oil prices are expected to average between $80 and $90 per barrel in 2024: \"In that kind of environment, you want to be positioned in upstream,\" the analyst tells Yahoo Finance. He recommends exploring names like Exxon (XOM), citing \"a lot of growth potential.\" With an uptick in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity throughout the sector, Glickman notes that the \"common theme\" is exposure to the Permian Basin, a trend he believes is \"likely to persist.\" Hunt acknowledges that supply and demand issues have been a headwind for the sector since the pandemic. However, with an \"energy transition underway\" she remains bullish on energy \"from a longer-term perspective.\" She also highlights the significant consolidation within the sector, with companies combining forces to boost operations and enhance their competitive edge.
