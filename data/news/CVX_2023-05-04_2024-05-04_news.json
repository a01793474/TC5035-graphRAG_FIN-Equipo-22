Truist Managing Director of Energy Research Neal Dingmann joins The Morning Brief to give insight into the energy sector and what investors can expect from Exxon and Chevron moving forward. Dingmann explains that growth will be accelerated by two upcoming projects in particular: \"They're going to have big growth...in Guyana and the Permian [Basin]. That's going to keep the remainder of their overall portfolio flat. Guyana is the one worth pointing out. If you look at the projects coming on through 2027 on a gross basis, which Exxon has 45% of this, that could do almost 1.2 billion barrels a day. You think that: the US alone is doing about 13 billion barrels. This is encroaching on over 10% of what the US alone could do with this project by 2027. That's why it's obviously a big deal on this litigation between Chevron and Exxon on the Hess deal.
