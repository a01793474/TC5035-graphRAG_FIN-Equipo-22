Joining Market Domination Overtime to discuss the results are Rosenblatt Securities Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Kevin Cassidy and Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead. While the quarter focused primarily on Qualcomm's handset sales, Moorhead highlights the company's automotive segment as \"the biggest surprise\" in the results. He notes that this sector witnessed a remarkable surge in its backlog, increasing from $30 billion to a staggering $45 billion over the course of 18 months, describing the feat as \"pretty big.\" Asked about AI's implications, Moorhead says that with Qualcomm's new chips featuring \"supersized AI\" capabilities, he is \"very optimistic\" that a supercycle could emerge in the latter half of the year. Cassidy echoed Moorhead's sentiment, describing Qualcomm's results as \"a relief\" amid reports of weakening demand in the Android sector. He agrees with the notion of a potential supercycle, saying that Qualcomm's unique features and applications could support such a development.
