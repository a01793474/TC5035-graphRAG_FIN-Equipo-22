[Headline]:Amazon Q1: Tailored ads could unlock new 'leg' for ad revenue
[Summary]:Amazon (AMZN) reported its first quarter earnings on Tuesday after the market's close, with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment posting a 17% year-over-year revenue spike. In the wake of this highly anticipated financial release, Jefferies Tech Research Analyst Brent Thill joins The Morning Brief to dissect the results. Thill characterizes Amazon's performance as "a mixed box of goods." He notes that AWS, the advertising business, and operating income all outperformed expectations in the first quarter results, stating, "Amazon works when you're in harvest mode, not invest mode." The numbers have left him "encouraged" about the stock's future prospects. On the advertising front, Thill highlights that the business is in "great shape" as Amazon continues to blend its advertising efforts with Prime Video. He emphasizes that sponsored ads will be tailored to each consumer's preferences. This strategic approach and Amazon's continued investment in its advertising capabilities could potentially unlock "a whole other leg" for the company, comprising an "advertising opportunity that we haven't even seen."

[Headline]:US STOCKS-Futures fall as chip stocks drag, Fed rate decision awaited
[Summary]:U.S. stock index futures fell on Wednesday as downbeat results dragged chip stocks and markets exercised caution ahead of more economic data and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later in the day.  Advanced Micro Devices shed 6.3% in premarket trading after its forecast for AI chip sales failed to impress investors, while Super Micro Computer lost 9.1% as the artificial intelligence server maker reported third-quarter revenue below estimates.  Investors will now await a slew of economic data during the day to further gauge the state of inflation in the U.S. economy, before tuning in to the Fed's interest rate decision at the end of its two-day meeting.
