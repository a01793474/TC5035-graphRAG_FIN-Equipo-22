Both topped earnings and revenue estimates, a trend consistent for major financial players who have reported earnings so far. Hennessy Funds Portfolio Manager David Ellison joins Market Domination to discuss the biggest boons and challenges for the banking sector. "I think the boogeyman or the real new issue is what's going to happen to the deposit side," Ellison explains. "Since the Silicon Valley-First Republic issues of a year or so ago, the deposit side has really been exposed as a risk factor for the industry that we've never had. So you see most of these large banks losing non-interest bearing deposits to the market..."

[Headline]:Bank earnings reveal capital markets' 'resurgence': Analyst
[Summary]:Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) have reported their first quarter earnings, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Bank of America posted revenue of $25.82 billion, surpassing estimates of $25.61 billion, alongside an adjusted EPS of $0.83, beating the $0.77 estimate. Similarly, Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $15.14 billion, outperforming the $14.46 billion estimate, with adjusted EPS of $2.02, exceeding the $1.66 estimate. To provide insights on these results, Argus Research Director of Financial Services Research Stephen Biggar joins Yahoo Finance. According to Biggar, the overarching theme is "a resurgence in capital markets" — a "durable upturn in investment banking." Biggar notes that the banks' capital markets-related businesses, such as wealth management, investment banking, and trading, are "doing much better." However, he acknowledges that the lending business and net interest income have "faced some struggles."

[Headline]:Big bank earnings show consumers may be losing spending steam
[Summary]:In the wake of earnings reports from major banks like Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), a mixed picture is emerging about the state of consumer spending. While the banks have stressed that consumers are continuing to spend despite uncertainty around inflation, there are also signs of rising consumer credit stress. Bank of America, for instance, reported that its net charge-offs — debts unlikely to be recovered — rose to $1.5 billion year over year, up from $807 million in the prior-year period. At the same time, banks have noted a decline in net interest income, which is the difference between what banks earn on loans and what they pay on deposits. These figures raise concerns about whether consumers can sustain their current spending habits in an inflationary environment.
