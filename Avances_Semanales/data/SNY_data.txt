[Headline]:Sanofi vaccine deal kicks off Novavax's 'new chapter': Analyst
[Summary]:Novavax (NVAX) shares are skyrocketing after the company announced a $1.2 billion deal with French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY). B. Riley Securities Managing Director & Group Head of Healthcare Research Mayank Mamtani joins Market Domination to break down the deal. The co-exclusive licensing agreement between the two pharmaceutical companies includes co-commercializing Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine and developing a combination vaccine for the flu and COVID-19. Mamtani highlights that the perception of Sanofi as rescuing Novavax during a post-pandemic struggle is "absolutely true, and it makes the company and the stock investable." He adds that the deal will mark a "new chapter" for Novavax. However, he warns of some of the realities the two companies will have to overcome to be successful. "In the past couple of years, we have completely misread how the vaccination uptake rates would look like," the analyst explains.
