Argus Research President John Eade joins the Morning Brief to provide insights into GE Aerospace's performance. Eade describes the current period as \"a good time right now for GE Aerospace\" citing multiple tailwinds in the aviation industry \u2014 namely Boeing's (BA) production backlog and assembly concerns \u2014 coupled with the company's outstanding quarterly report, painting \"a great story\" for its future. Eade highlights that the separation into an independent entity allowed investors to \"capture value\" that was previously missing under GE's original broad business model. Shifting his focus to Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eade mentions that the aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor lacks \"commercial exposure\" and cannot grow as rapidly as GE Aerospace \"despite the good news out of Washington\" surrounding potential foreign aid packages to Israel and Ukraine.

As part of their Artemis missions, for the first time in over 50 years, NASA hopes to repeat that feat and put a human on the moon in 2026. One of the biggest differences this time: the private sector is helping them do it. In addition to major companies, like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), one of the businesses assisting in NASA\u2019s mission is SpaceX. The private company, co-founded by Elon Musk, introduced a new commercial era of space exploration. In 2023 SpaceX executed 96 successful missions, launching a rocket on average every four days. There are many companies following SpaceX\u2019s lead. Yahoo Finance got an inside look at one of those businesses: Firefly Aerospace. Firefly is also playing a role in NASA\u2019s mission as part of the $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative, aimed at developing reliable transportation options to the moon for supplies and research. Later this year, Firefly will be the third American company to attempt an unmanned lunar landing with their Blue Ghost spacecraft. That mission is backed by a $112 million contract from NASA. While Firefly plans to continue its work with NASA, the company is expecting the commercial side of space to become a larger part of its business, with the industry expected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035, according to the World Economic Forum. In an effort to capitalize on this, and maximize speed and cost efficiency, Firefly\u2019s mission is to become an end-to-end space transportation company. The company is manufacturing rockets, including an upcoming medium launch vehicle in partnership with Northrop Grumman (NOC), orbital vehicles to service spacecraft on their missions, and landers, like Blue Ghost. If you\u2019re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what\u2019s NEXT.
