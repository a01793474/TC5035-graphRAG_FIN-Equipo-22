[Headline]:Home improvement retailers: Top choices for the retail sector
[Summary]:It has been a big week for the retail sector, with a slew of big box retailers reporting earnings, from Walmart (WMT) to Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD). The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading was also released this week, its figure coming in lower than expected.  Argus Research Senior Analyst Chris Graja and Washington Crossing Advisors Senior Portfolio Manager Chad Morganlander join Market Domination to give insight into how investors should navigate the retail sector. Morganlander shares his thoughts on the current strength of the consumer, which he notes is "quite strong": "They've got a lot of tailwind regarding savings. Wage inflation has been going higher — that bodes well for consumption, as well. It's a full employment picture here in the United States, so for us, we think that bodes well overall in aggregate for big box retailers." Graja who has a Buy rating on both Home Depot and Lowe's (LOW) explains that home improvement retailers are currently well position: "They're good quality businesses. They pay dividends, and the thing is, I don't think we know exactly when the turn is going to be. And the other thing is, like all we need to see is a little bit of sign of an inflection. So I think the long-term thesis makes a lot of sense looking at Harvard's leading indicator of remodeling activity."

That’s because, even though rates haven’t dropped much yet, mortgages can be refinanced in the future. Therefore, a high number of consumers are selling their homes and buying new ones because they are confident that rates will go down in the medium-term, which will enable them to lower their interest rates through refinancing.

[Headline]:Home improvement stocks: Analyst foresees 'renovation renaissance'
[Summary]:Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) have received Buy ratings from Mizuho analysts, as demand in the housing market starts to recover. Mizuho Americas Director and Senior Analyst David Bellinger joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss this move, expressing his expectation for "a renovation renaissance" in the coming years. Bellinger highlights Lowe's as the "top pick" due to its strong positioning in the do-it-yourself (DIY) segment. Bellinger explains that when homeowners first purchase a house, they are often engaged in a flurry of home improvement projects for the next two to three years. With Lowe's outperforming in key DIY categories such as paint, outdoor, and patio, he states that the company has "a leg-up" in capturing this demand. While acknowledging the recent "freeze on housing activity," Bellinger notes that "there is a lot of demand out there" from potential homebuyers seeking to enter the market. He also emphasizes that long-term home improvement dynamics remain robust, with nearly 50% of the housing stock in the United States being "aged 40 or older." Bellinger describes these older homes as "leaky buckets," foreshadowing the need for ongoing maintenance— furthering his bullish outlook on home improvement stocks.

[Summary]:In response to the escalating challenge of retail shrink, which rose to over $112 billion in 2022, retailers including Target (TGT), Walgreens (WBA) and Home Depot (HD) are investing in AI-powered technology. The goal? To preserve a good shopping experience while also fighting theft, a problem that’s impacting margins and causing safety concerns. The scope of the theft problem is hard to measure, though mentions of organized retail crime rose by 43% on earnings calls in the first half of 2023. To find clarity on this issue, Yahoo Finance explores a first of its kind, AI-driven heat map that could empower retailers to share real-time crime data with each other, and gets an exclusive look at the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the rise in organized retail crime, which they say is about much more than petty shoplifting. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.For more on our NEXT series, click here, and tune tune in to Yahoo Finance Live for more expert insight and the latest market action, Monday through Friday.
