As earnings from the Magnificent Seven roll out, investors may be looking for opportunities to enter the market. Simplify Asset Management Chief Strategist Michael Green and Wealth Enhancement Group Senior Vice President and Financial Advisor Nicole Webb join Market Domination to discuss investment opportunities during this big week of tech earnings and beyond. Webb gives her overview of earnings so far: \"To us, it's just all of this playing out of where does the earnings growth for the rest of the year come from, and we had anticipated a deceleration from those mega tech names in the back half of this year. And so kind of below the surface we see this churning, the broadening that everyone is talking about and some of that relative outperformance from places like the equal weight S&P (^SPXEW).\" Green follows up with: \"I think the biggest surprises that have come out of earnings in general have been things like General Motors' (GM) announcement today that was accompanied by an astonishing buyback where they shrank the quantity of shares by around 17%. This is in contrast, that level of buyback is unprecedented for many of these companies for that to be happening in open markets. And it's just highlighting that the exceptionally cheap areas of the market as long as there's a little bit of support that's coming in through the interest rate space, that really looks like that could be an area of focus.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
