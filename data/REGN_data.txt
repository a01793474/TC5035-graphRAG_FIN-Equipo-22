[Summary]:Bristol-Myers Squibb’s market capitalization has dropped so much over the past year that it is now arguably no longer part of the big pharma club.  After reporting disappointing earnings figures on Thursday, the company’s shares fell sharply, giving it a market capitalization of about $95 billion.  The problem for Bristol-Myers is that its older blockbuster products, cancer drug Revlimid and blood thinner Eliquis, are expected to decline in the coming years and investors aren’t convinced that the company has enough growth drivers in the near term.

[Summary]:AbbVie said on Thursday its drug, Rinvoq, for treating a type of inflammatory skin condition was found to be more effective than Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi's Dupixent in a late-stage head-to-head study.
