[Headline]:Fed rates, Tesla Supercharger backpedal, Novavax's 'new chapter': Market Domination
[Summary]:On today's episode of Market Domination, Yahoo Finance Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down the latest earnings and major trends Wall Street analysts are eyeing. Sweetgreen (SG) shares soar after the company topped first quarter revenue estimates and raised full-year guidance. Similarly, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) shares are rising after the company reported that its sales jumped nearly 60% year over year, largely due to AI demand. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Managing Director Dan Skelly joins Market Domination to discuss some signs pointing to the Fed potentially cutting interest rates several times before the end of the year. Novavax (NVAX) shares skyrocket after the company announced a $1.2 billion vaccine deal with French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY). B. Riley Securities Managing Director & Group Head of Healthcare Research Mayank Mamtani explains how the partnership marks a "new chapter" for Novavax after a post-pandemic slump. Yahoo Finance reporter Pras Subramanian joins to discuss Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk backpedaling his recent move to shrink the company's Supercharger team. As many legacy automakers signed up to participate in Tesla's Supercharger network, Subramanian says Musk is trying to fix the issue he created after laying off a majority of the Supercharger team. A new edition of Good Buy or Goodbye analyzes two companies in the finance sector: PayPal (PYPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS). This post was written by Melanie Riehl

[Headline]:Goldman Sachs stock not ideal 'at today's price': Strategist
[Summary]:On today's edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, Market Domination's Julie Hyman is joined by Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Member Thomas Hayes to delve into his top portfolio moves in the fintech landscape when compared to traditional banking options. Hayes recommends PayPal (PYPL) as a stock to buy, citing the appointment of the company's new CEO Alex Chriss as the source of optimistic upside. He highlights Chriss's experience from his previous role at Intuit (INTU), noting that the valuable lessons learned there can be brought to PayPal "to revitalize the brand." Additionally, Hayes points to the re-rating that has occurred on the stock as margins reaccelerate, evident from PayPal's impressive first-quarter earnings beat. Furthermore, he emphasizes that the company generates around $5 billion a year in free cash flow, providing PayPal with "all the runway they need." On the other hand, Hayes names Goldman Sachs (GS) as a stock that investors should avoid, despite his favorable view of the major bank. He acknowledges that he doesn't like the stock "at today's prices" and its excessive dependence on trading profits.  Hayes states that Goldman Sachs' attempts to generate revenue through other avenues have not been as successful, highlighting the need for the company to spend time "building out the recurring revenue businesses" they have. Lastly, Hayes believes an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve would be wholly necessary for Goldman Sachs to see significant gains based on its investment banking franchise.
