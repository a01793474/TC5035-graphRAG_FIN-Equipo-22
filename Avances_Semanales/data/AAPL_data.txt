[Summary]:A federal judge on Wednesday questioned whether Apple has set up a gauntlet of exasperating hurdles to discourage the use of alternative payment options in iPhone apps, despite a court order seeking to create more ways for consumers to pay for digital services.  The verbal sparring between Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers and the head of Apple's app store kicked off a hearing focused on whether Apple is still steering U.S. consumers to its once-exclusive app payment system in defiance of an injunction aimed at promoting more choices that could help lower prices.  Gonzalez Rogers' order requires Apple to allow app developers to display links to other options besides the company's own payment system in the U.S. Apple makes billions of dollars annually from that setup, which imposes commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within the most popular iPhone apps.

[Summary]:Several 'Magnificent Seven' names have announced major investments in AI technology after reporting strong earnings. Yahoo Finance Anchors Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita are joined by Nuveen CEO Saira Malik at the Annual Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss whether there has been an overallocation in Big Tech names, leading to possible underperformance. "I think it's the year of being selective, and you saw that last week with Meta (META), which actually put up a good quarter with 27% revenue growth. But the whisper numbers were for 30% revenue growth. Stock goes down because it's over over-owned. Now you look at Apple (AAPL), where if you look at the fundamentals of the quarter, it's more about the next iPhone cycle seasonality, trade. But the stock was under-owned. So Apple goes up. So I think that crowding in these tech stocks is important for these stocks," Malik tells Yahoo Finance.
