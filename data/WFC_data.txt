[Summary]:U.S. stocks sold off on Friday after major U.S. banks' results failed to impress, capping a week marked by market-moving inflation data, evolving expectations for U.S. Federal Reserve policy, and looming geopolitical tensions.  The S&P 500 index notched its biggest weekly percentage loss since January, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average's weekly loss was its steepest since March 2023.  "When we look at what's happened in the macro space, inflation has taken a turn for the worse and that has put more pressure on companies to deliver this earnings season," said Mike Dickson, head of research at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.

[Headline]:WRAPUP 1-US banks' profit picture less clear with cloudy rates trajectory
[Summary]:The uncertain trajectory of interest rates is making it hard for U.S. banks to forecast profits and leading some to adopt a cautious stance for the remainder of the year.  Banks have reaped high profits in recent quarters as the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in March 2022 to tame inflation, which boosted net interest income (NII), or the difference between what lenders earn on loans and pay out for deposits.  "It's certainly challenging these days to forecast NII, given all of the volatility that we've seen across a lot of the different data points, as well as some of the uncertainty that's out there relative to how our clients are going to behave," Wells Fargo's finance chief Michael Santomassimo said.

[Headline]:Boon for big banks: More consumers leaned on credit cards in Q1
[Summary]:More consumers leaned on their credit cards in the first quarter, across Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) cards. Yahoo Finance reporter David Hollerith joins Wealth! to discuss what this tendency means for consumers and their finances. Spending and credit card loan balances have gone up year over year, Hollerith says. As business loans have been growing at a slower pace, Hollerith calls the increased consumer spending and balances a "bright spot" for these banks in terms of loan growth. However, it is difficult to pinpoint sticky inflation as the direct cause of higher credit card spending, Hollerith adds.

[Headline]:JPMorgan earnings call struck 'cautious' tone on high rates
[Summary]:JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicked off earnings season by reporting their first-quarter results, all topping their quarterly estimates. The Big Bank stocks have all since slid lower Friday morning. HSBC Head of US Financials Research Saul Martinez explains the most important figures from these three major banks, including quarterly net interest income while the financial sector traverses inflation and higher for longer interest rates. "If you think back to the first quarter, we had six rate cuts priced in. Now we have around two rate cuts. So I think there was some hope that that change in the rate outlook coupled with the fact that JPMorgan has been fairly conservative in their net interest income guidance, that that would lead to an increase in the outlook," Martinez tells Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "The tone was, in my view, was somewhat cautious. They are still saying they feel like there is going to be pressure on deposit pricing, that maybe that they are over-earning on deposits..."

[Headline]:Consumer credit signals 'outright weakness,' spending may drop
[Summary]:Stocks are facing pressure as the markets digest the disappointing earnings reports from major banks, including JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). NewEdge Wealth Chief Investment Officer Cameron Dawson joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the market outlook. Dawson notes that she is closely following bank discussions about credit health for both consumers and corporations — in other words, how end customers are dealing with a higher-for-longer environment. Despite bank conversation about post-pandemic normalization, Dawson questions whether new levels of delinquency and higher balances compared to disposable income actually represent "outright weakness" in credit. Dawson acknowledges that consumers have been able to "keep on spending" despite higher interest rates. However, she points out that other factors, such as rising debt levels and flatlining wage growth, could start to impact consumer spending going forward. Regarding recession fears, Dawson indicates that GDP growth estimates will be a key data point to monitor.

[Headline]:Bank earnings: JPMorgan slides on net interest income woes
[Summary]:Shares of major banks JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) opened Friday's trading session under pressure following the release of their first-quarter earnings reports. A key factor being closely watched is the decline in net interest income across these financial institutions. This decline in net interest income, which reflects the difference between the interest banks earn and the interest they pay out, is a concern as consumers face mounting spending pressures in a higher for longer interest rate environment.
