[Headline]:Investor playbook: The biggest earnings surprises so far
[Summary]:Wall Street gears up for a number of big tech earnings this week as many of the tech giants hold much of the value of the S&P 500 (^GSPC). As earnings from the Magnificent Seven roll out, investors may be looking for opportunities to enter the market. Simplify Asset Management Chief Strategist Michael Green and Wealth Enhancement Group Senior Vice President and Financial Advisor Nicole Webb join Market Domination to discuss investment opportunities during this big week of tech earnings and beyond. Webb gives her overview of earnings so far: "To us, it's just all of this playing out of where does the earnings growth for the rest of the year come from, and we had anticipated a deceleration from those mega tech names in the back half of this year. And so kind of below the surface we see this churning, the broadening that everyone is talking about and some of that relative outperformance from places like the equal weight S&P (^SPXEW)." Green follows up with: "I think the biggest surprises that have come out of earnings in general have been things like General Motors' (GM) announcement today that was accompanied by an astonishing buyback where they shrank the quantity of shares by around 17%. This is in contrast, that level of buyback is unprecedented for many of these companies for that to be happening in open markets. And it's just highlighting that the exceptionally cheap areas of the market as long as there's a little bit of support that's coming in through the interest rate space, that really looks like that could be an area of focus."

[Summary]:If bonds can earn you nearly as much as stocks, but at a reduced risk, then the case for owning equities becomes less compelling.  With bond yields climbing when stocks were already getting pricey, a key measure known as the equity risk premium is sounding alarm bells for some.  Over the past week, this gauge—measured by the difference between the S&P 500's earnings yield and the yield on 10-year Treasurys—touched the lowest level in more than 20 years, notes markets writer Gunjan Banerji.  The realization that higher rates aren't going away soon is also spurring businesses to move ahead with deals, despite the higher debt costs associated, says columnist Telis Demos.

[Headline]:This analyst isn't worried about ASML chip demand. Here's why
[Summary]:Shares of ASML Holding (ASML) are under pressure on Wednesday after the company reported that its net sales fell 21.6% year-over-year. To discuss the situation, Insinger Gilissen Senior Equity Analyst Jos Versteeg joins the Morning Brief. Versteeg explains that the demand for ASML's products is not lacking, but rather, the order flow is "lumpy." He points to 2023 order inflows as an example, with the second half of the year witnessing order inflows of $13 billion — $9 billion of which was in the last quarter alone. Versteeg cautions investors not to read too much into these order inflow numbers, as they do not necessarily "express that the market is weak." Furthermore, Versteeg notes that for the past two months, semiconductor sales have been declining, suggesting that the market could be "hesitating." Coupled with the order inflows reported by ASML, Versteeg understands why investors may be "shocked." However, he emphasizes that order inflow numbers do not accurately reflect the company's performance. Despite these short-term fluctuations, Versteeg remains "positive" on ASML's long-term prospects and has "no worries" about the company's future demand and profit success. "There's a very strong long-term demand for semiconductors and ASML is in the right spot," Versteeg tells Yahoo Finance.

Chief executive Peter Wennink said on a call after the company's first quarter earnings that there was currently no reason the company could not provide servicing for equipment it has sold to Chinese customers.  The U.S. and Dutch government are in talks on restricting ASML's ability to provide maintenance and servicing for advanced equipment sold to Chinese chipmakers that require an export licence under new Dutch rules introduced in the past year.
