[Summary]:Big Tech and media companies like Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Reddit (RDDT), and more are seeing large jumps in their ad revenue year-over-year, with Reddit even seeing a 39% gain. As these companies realize potential in their data sets and money to be made from digital advertising, they continue to vie for any competitive edge they can find. TikTok is an incredibly powerful platform that sees huge volumes of user traffic which in turn can drive consumer growth for companies, both large brands and small businesses. With the US leveraging a potential ban against TikTok if its parent company ByteDance doesn't divest from it, how can these tech giants stir up even tighter competition if a ban ends up going through? MikMak CEO Rachel Tipograph joins Catalysts to discuss her company's findings from ad revenue data and the power TikTok holds in the business world. Tipograph explains: "TikTok is typically now around our second most trafficked social platform. It goes Meta, then TikTok, then an environment like YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and then X is irrelevant. I share this because I'm not seeing brands pull back from TikTok. I think right now they're actually trying to put their pedal on the gas while TikTok's around. TikTok is an amazing channel to drive consumer growth. We're seeing it in beauty, we're starting to see it in grocery." She then affirms: "If TikTok was to go away, Meta would win, YouTube would win, CTV would win. TikTok is really a play of brand awareness and video, and so those dollars would just get reallocated."

[Summary]:Chip company Arm Holdings' (ARM) disappointing 2025 forecast could be signaling slowdowns in AI demands. Big Tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have all announced major investments in building out their AI infrastructures. While the plans show confidence in the future, will they actually pay off? Bokeh Capital Partners Founder and Chief Investment Officer Kimberly Forrest joins Morning Brief to give insight into the AI sector and discuss which companies are in the best position to actually benefit from AI investments. When asked about when investors will see real payoffs from these big investments from AI, Forrest says: "Building out the data center is part of it, then you're going to have companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), and everybody else is going to pile in and start using the generative AI to maybe increase productivity... And I would look for who do you think is most likely to benefit from using generative AI. And we've just mentioned them, right? Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, and to me Microsoft is really probably [in] the best position because they'll get people to actually pay for it, not just advertising dollars."

[Headline]:Amazon building 'modern pharmacy' of the future: Medical Officer
[Summary]:Since 2020, Amazon (AMZN) has been making efforts to extend its online retail stronghold into the pharmacy world. The company announced that it expects same-day pharmacy delivery services to become available in up to a dozen US cities by the end of the year. Amazon Pharmacy Chief Medical Officer Dr. Vin Gupta joins Wealth! to discuss the move and what the current state of pharmacies lacks for the average consumer. "If your provider can get that prescription in before, say, 5:00, we're able to get that to your door before the end of the evening," Gupta explains. He highlights the importance of this service for consumers with acute conditions, saying, "that time to treatment is critical." The service will not have additional charges for same-day deliveries, "and that's exactly what people expect from Amazon," Gupta says. "We know that 30% of people don't pick up their refills on time, or if ever, because it's an inconvenient experience, especially if you're not feeling well," adding that he believes Amazon's new initiative will make major strides in the average consumer's health. The service will have a different sign-on and portal experience, keeping health data separate and private from users' retail profiles. Gupta explains that it will also offer several different ways to pay with or without insurance, touting a discount savings program and automatically applied manufacturer coupons. He adds that in addition to the home delivery service, a team of clinical pharmacists will be available 24/7 to answer any patient questions. "We're truly building the modern pharmacy that the future needs," he tells Brad Smith and Anjalee Khemlani.

[Headline]:How Pinterest ad revenue is 'accelerating': CEO
[Summary]:Pinterest (PINS) has boosted its advertising efforts with deals from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). The company has also utilized AI to improve personalized recommendations for its users. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita are joined by Pinterest CEO Bill Ready at the Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss the impact of new deals from tech giants. On the success of the deals with his company, Ready states that some of the increase ad revenue comes from: "It's really because of the actionability of the platform. That's through a combination of efforts. A lot of it is retailers coming to us directly, but then we've also, as you noted, augmented that first-party demand on our platform with third-party demand coming from Amazon...Google we added more recently... And so that is helping to bring more shoppable, actionable inventory on to the platform, but it really is a composite effect. What I would say, if you step back from it all, Pinterest is firing on all cylinders."
