To me, I'm watching that entire sector and saying where the US consumer is shopping, that's the sector I want to watch because that tells me where we spend our dollars has the most sustainability in the long run and today more than ever, the dollar value sector is grabbing a more lion's share of the US consumer than ever before."

The goal? To preserve a good shopping experience while also fighting theft, a problem that’s impacting margins and causing safety concerns.

[Summary]:Retailers such as Target (TGT) and Foot Locker (FL) are set to report their quarterly results this week. Storch Advisors CEO Jerry Storch joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the current state of the consumer. Storch, the former CEO of Toys "R" Us and Hudson's Bay, says so far "the consumer has held up pretty well." Despite this resilience, he notes that "inflation is still real" and other pressures remain, so investors will be watching retail results "with a very sharp eye." Retail earnings reported so far, he says, have been a "mixed bag" with "no real breakout." He points out that retailers focused on value "have done well," while others in apparel and discretionary categories have "struggled." This divergence highlights the consumer's current emphasis on essentials and stretching their budgets.

[Headline]:Are consumers truly resilient? What retail revenues say
[Summary]:Many big retailers will release their earnings reports next week, including Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY). With continued inflation and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy decision, Wall Street is turning toward other factors like the strength of the US consumer to better understand economic conditions. BMO Capital Markets Managing Director Simeon Siegel joins Yahoo Finance to discuss upcoming retail earnings and the state of the American consumer during economic headwinds. Siegel elaborates on the state of the consumer:"It sounds pretty scary, so if the question is whether the consumer is healthy or not, I don't know. If the question is whether the consumer is spending or not, the revenues are saying they are. And so I know there's this perception that because of inflation on staple items, people aren't buying discretionary, but I'm not seeing that in the results... We'll see TJX (TJX) give us a very good snapshot on people that are specifically looking for value, but then we'll see Birkenstock (BIRK), on the other hand, where people are buying, perhaps paying more comfortable spending on."
