[Headline]:Apple is catching up with the AI revolution: Dan Ives
[Summary]:As Big Tech companies reported earnings, they also revealed a massive wave of planned spending on AI projects and infrastructure. Some companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have pulled ahead, while others, like Apple (AAPL), have faced mounting challenges. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives joins The Morning Brief to discuss what he calls "the fourth industrial revolution" in AI and Apple's advances on the front. Ives states that Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference will be paramount for Apple: "I think it's probably the most important event for Apple that we've seen potentially in a decade because this is going to be [CEO Tim] Cook laying out the AI strategy on the services side for developers, what I believe is really the start of an AI app store in terms of how that's going to morph and then its proprietary AI technology in iPhone 16, which will launch in September."

[Summary]:Chip company Arm Holdings' (ARM) disappointing 2025 forecast could be signaling slowdowns in AI demands. Big Tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have all announced major investments in building out their AI infrastructures. While the plans show confidence in the future, will they actually pay off? Bokeh Capital Partners Founder and Chief Investment Officer Kimberly Forrest joins Morning Brief to give insight into the AI sector and discuss which companies are in the best position to actually benefit from AI investments. When asked about when investors will see real payoffs from these big investments from AI, Forrest says: "Building out the data center is part of it, then you're going to have companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), and everybody else is going to pile in and start using the generative AI to maybe increase productivity... And I would look for who do you think is most likely to benefit from using generative AI. And we've just mentioned them, right? Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, and to me Microsoft is really probably [in] the best position because they'll get people to actually pay for it, not just advertising dollars."

[Headline]:Arm Q4 results: Why this analyst isn't surprised by the forecast
[Summary]:Shares of Arm Holdings (ARM) are falling Wednesday despite surpassing expectations on both the top and bottom lines in its fourth quarter results. To shed light on this unexpected market reaction, New Street Research Analyst Rolf Bulk joins Yahoo Finance. Bulk acknowledges that while Arm had a solid quarter, the company's full-year guidance came in "a bit shy of consensus." However, he says he is not surprised by Arm's outlook, citing certain parts of the business, such as "licensing in particular is quite lumpy." Bulk attributes this guidance to Arm's inability to determine which clients will continue to purchase their products consistently. He adds that clients who purchase from the company this quarter are not guaranteed to do so in the next, making it difficult to "forecast that out over multi-quarters, let alone a year."

[Summary]:As earnings season unfolds, companies like Uber (UBER) have taken center stage with their financial reports. Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick joins Market Domination to provide insights on the day's trading takeaways. Addressing Uber's share price decline despite beating earnings, Sosnick suggests that the impact on the markets will be "Uber-specific." However, he notes a broader trend where companies posting earnings beats have not seen their stock prices reflect that performance. Sosnick explains that "people are looking through them [earnings] to see how they're managing their businesses." "We've gotten sort of spoiled by the Nvidias (NVDA) of the world, the beat and raise, then beat again and then raise again," Sosnick told Yahoo Finance, adding: "That's not necessarily normal, and so I think what happens is the markets do tend to punish disappointment more than they reward success on earnings.

Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the report and how the sector's growth was boosted by the Biden administration's CHIPS Act. The 203% projected increase in fabrication capacity overshadows the prior decade's 11% increase as demand for chips in new technology and artificial intelligence surges. The report also highlights that the US will grow its share of the ability to build advanced logic chips, which are chips with transistors that are below 10 nanometers in size. Advanced logic chips are mostly built overseas, but the US is expected to have 28% of the global capacity by 2032.

[Headline]:Nvidia earnings, geopolitics could offer needed market 'catalysts'
[Summary]:As company earnings continue to beat Wall Street expectations, US Equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) are rising from April lows. The market has also begun to price in the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping higher interest rates for longer, but is there more for investors to consider for the next few months? Horizon Investments Chief Investment Officer Scott Ladner and Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods join Market Domination to provide insight into navigating the market during the current economic environment. Ladner argues that the market needs a new catalyst. In the absence of any large upcoming catalyst, investors may be staring down a more challenging few months: "We could actually have some, some positive catalysts from the geopolitical standpoint. But I don't see anything huge on the horizon, frankly. I mean, I think this is gonna be a bit of a grinder, probably a little bit grinder for the next few months, but grinding up rather than down. " Woods questions how far earnings can carry the market: "Individual earnings, they're not enough to take that next leg higher. Amazon (AMZN) made a new high today. It's on the verge of a major breakout. If you look at it on a weekly chart, it hasn't taken us there. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), did, Microsoft (MSFT) didn't on solid earnings. So we're not seeing that euphoria. We're not seeing that tailwind we want to see. " For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Headline]:Is Apple 'in stealth mode' while acquiring AI companies?
[Summary]:In another installment of Yahoo Finance's Good Buy or Goodbye, RSE Ventures Co-Founder and CEO Matt Higgins joins Josh Lipton to share his insights into iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chip company Arm Holdings (ARM). Higgins names Apple shares as his good buy, stating that the tech leader may be on the up-and-up after the stock slid in 2024's first quarter. Higgins points to Apple's quick adoption and integration of AI into its devices as a major catalyst. "They have been gobbling up AI companies below the radar — I think they've bought 32 of them," Higgins says. "Clearly they're working on it because If they don't they're facing an existential threat to their very survival. I think Apple has been keeping its head down while its stock has faltered." Arm is the stock Higgins would wish to say good buy to, calling the semiconductor designer overvalued as early investors were "looking for different ways to chase Nvidia (NVDA)" in the broad chip landscape.

[Summary]:At the Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Intel (INTC) each introduced new chips. Google's Axion is a custom Arm-based server chip and Intel's Gaudi 3 is an AI chip designed to take on Nvidia's (NVDA) most popular AI processors. Moor Insights & Strategies founder and CEO Patrick Moorhead joins Market Domination to give insight into the booming chip sector and how these announcements will impact the market. Speaking on Google's announcement and position in AI sector, Moorhead states, "Google has a lot to prove. I don't think anybody is questioning the company's technical competency. In fact, they wrote the groundbreaking research paper on generative AI and I think what people are questioning is, can they extend what they do in consumer search to the generative AI world? And then I think even more difficult, extending it to the commercial market, which is what the conference I'm at right now it is all about and they've had some stumbles. Every major announcement that they've made has come with some baggage." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
