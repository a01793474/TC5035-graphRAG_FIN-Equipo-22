[Headline]:WRAPUP 1-Nestle, Danone see price hikes slowing after years of sharp increases
[Summary]:Two of the world's top consumer goods companies, Danone and Nestle, said on Thursday they will slow price increases in 2024 after two years of hikes that have prompted shoppers to seek cheaper alternatives for basic goods like yoghurt and coffee.  But Danone, which owns brands including Evian and Badoit water and Activia yoghurt, warned prices would still rise, citing a need to offset labour costs and shipping prices.  Their comments follow British rival Unilever, the maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap, which also said this month that price increases would start to ease.
