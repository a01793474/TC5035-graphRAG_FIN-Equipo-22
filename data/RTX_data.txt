[Summary]:After Iran's weekend air attack against Israel, concerns about the potential impacts on the overall market have begun to rise. Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney joins Wealth! to discuss pricing geopolitical shocks into portfolios and market risks to watch. Mahoney offers suggestions as to how investors can hedge against exogenous foreign relations threats: "One can use, a military defense company like RTX, Raytheon (RTX), is one of the symbols viewers can take a look at. Oil (BZ=F, CL=F), whether you buy a basket or individual stocks, like Exxon (XOM) or Chevron (CVX). There's definitely ways to go around as a hedge, not as, again, we really think technology and the big tech is still the way to go, the outsized earnings that they have, but if you want to say, hey, I want to hedge my portfolio a little bit, inverse ETFs maybe some oil, maybe some defense contractors or maybe selling off 20-25% put in cash, so we get that wish down."
