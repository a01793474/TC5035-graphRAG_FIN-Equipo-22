[Headline]:The tech giants to benefit from AI bullishness: Strategist
[Summary]:Chip company Arm Holdings' (ARM) disappointing 2025 forecast could be signaling slowdowns in AI demands. Big Tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have all announced major investments in building out their AI infrastructures. While the plans show confidence in the future, will they actually pay off? Bokeh Capital Partners Founder and Chief Investment Officer Kimberly Forrest joins Morning Brief to give insight into the AI sector and discuss which companies are in the best position to actually benefit from AI investments. When asked about when investors will see real payoffs from these big investments from AI, Forrest says: "Building out the data center is part of it, then you're going to have companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), and everybody else is going to pile in and start using the generative AI to maybe increase productivity... And I would look for who do you think is most likely to benefit from using generative AI. And we've just mentioned them, right? Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, and to me Microsoft is really probably [in] the best position because they'll get people to actually pay for it, not just advertising dollars."

[Summary]:(Reuters) -Intel said on Wednesday its sales would take a hit after the U.S. revoked some of the chipmaker's export licenses for a customer in China, in a move Beijing complained was going too far in the name of national security.  Intel did not disclose the name of the Chinese customer that had licenses canceled in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but Reuters had reported on Tuesday the U.S. has revoked licenses that allowed companies, including Intel and Qualcomm, to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies.  The release of Huawei's first AI-enabled laptop in April, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel's new Core Ultra 9 processor, drew fire from Republican lawmakers, who said it suggests that the Commerce Department had given the green light to Intel to sell the chip to Huawei.
