{"news": [{"date": "20240417110621", "headline": "McDonald's history: Beyond the Ticker", "summary": "With over 38,000 locations in more than 100 countries, McDonald's (MCD) is a global icon in the fast food industry. In 2023, McDonald's generated over $25 billion dollars in revenue, up nearly 10% compared to the year before. Let's dive into the company's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker. 1940 The McDonald's brothers, Dick and Maurice, opened the first McDonald's restaurant on May 15, 1940, in San Bernardino, California. 1954-1955 Ray Kroc purchased the rights to franchise McDonald\u2019s and opened the first franchised restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois. 1955-1965 Kroc bought the brothers out, then developed its current model of owning the real estate that McDonald\u2019s franchise locations are on. 1965 In April 1965, McDonald's went public via an initial public offering at $22.50 per share. 1972 McDonald's hit a milestone \u2013 generating $1 billion in sales. 1990 The first McDonald's restaurant opened in the Soviet Union in Pushkin Square, Moscow, marking a symbolic moment of the Cold War, serving thousands of customers. 2003 In the early 2000s, the thriving food chain was met with competition and tragedy. Former executive James Cantalupo came out of retirement to lead the company, but in 2004 he suddenly passed away after 16 months at the helm. 2004 Life-long McDonald\u2019s employee Charlie Bell was named CEO but tragically passed away from cancer shortly after. Amid the two tragedies, the movie Super Size Me took off - resulting in McDonald\u2019s getting rid of the Super Size option. 2005-2012 Jim Skinner served as CEO, taking the company through the Great Financial Recession. 2012-2015 Don Thompson served as CEO, then retired as he faced pressure over declining sales. 2015 Steve Easterbrook then took the top seat, and in an attempt to reinvigorate its brand, McDonald's launched its all-day breakfast menu. Soon after, Easterbrook was fired for having an \u201cinappropriate personal relationship\u201d with an employee, according to the SEC. 2019 US president Chris Kempcinski was promoted to CEO, taking the company through the Covid-19 pandemic. 2023 McDonald's continues to expand and evolve, with its latest concept, CosMc's, a drive-thru-only restaurant featuring McCafe products, beverages, and treats. From a single restaurant to billions and billions served, McDonald's aims to hold its top spot as the quintessential American fast food chain. From tech giants to retail titans,\u00a0Beyond the Ticker\u00a0is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Joining Market Domination to discuss the importance of value within the restaurant industry are Bernstein Senior Analyst for U.S. Restaurants Danilo Gargiulo and UBS Executive Director of Equity Research Dennis Geiger. Gargiulo acknowledges that attracting customers has become \"incrementally harder,\" with \"traffic slowing down across the entire industry.\" He emphasizes that chains need to \"be mindful\" of ensuring value is a core component of their offerings. However, for giants like McDonald's (MCD), which operate under a franchise model, the question of profitability for individual franchisees and aligning their interests arises. Geiger echoes the sentiment, noting \"an industry slowdown\" within the quick-service restaurant and fast-food sectors. He attributes this trend to a variety of factors, including price increases, the broader inflationary environment, and even tightening consumer budgets. Regardless of the root causes, Geiger asserts that \"there's softness\" in consumer demand, particularly among lower-income consumers.
