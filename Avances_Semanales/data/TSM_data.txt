[Headline]:US chip output to see massive growth by 2032: Industry leader
[Summary]:The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) projects the United States' manufacturing capacity for semiconductors to increase by more than three-fold by 2032. The Biden administration sought to expand domestic chip productions via the CHIPS Act by awarding grants to chipmakers Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent months. SIA CEO and President John Neuffer joins Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita to review the expected growth for chip fabrication and foundry businesses through the CHIPS Act investments into the private sector. "It took us decades to get to this point," Neuffer discloses. "The two big numbers that I find most interesting coming out of this report are what would our global manufacturing footprint be without the CHIPS Act and would've fallen to 8%. With the CHIPS Act, it's at 14%. That's nearly the double the positive result. So... it's gonna take us years to kind of climb back. But with the CHIPS Act and with all these private sector investments, we absolutely turned the corner and are heading now in, in the right direction." Neuffer broadly estimates that without the invigoration of the CHIPS Act, the US would be producing next to zero of the world's chips in that 2032 timeframe: "With the CHIPS Act... we'll be manufacturing 28% of those chips. So that, that's the kind of fundamental shift in terrain." Turning his attention to China's own semiconductor infrastructure, Neuffer characterizes the nation's chip industry as "very focused" in its output of legacy chips. But finds that China's lean into manufacturing will create an "over capacity" of chips that could lead to several down cycles for American chip makers. Some global officials have stood by their view that China's manufacturing push, driving global competition in areas such as chips and electric vehicles (EV), isn't going to "fix the challenge" in its economy brought on by deflating consumer sentiment.
