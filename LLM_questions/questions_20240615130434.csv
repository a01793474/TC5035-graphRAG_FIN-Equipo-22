What is Microsoft's approach to intellectual property?,"Microsoft works actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to their software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. They are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 69,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending worldwide. They also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, they enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. They may also purchase or license technology that they incorporate into their products and services. At times, they make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling their external development community. Their increasing engagement with open source software will also cause them to license their intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.",msft-20220630/1.txt
