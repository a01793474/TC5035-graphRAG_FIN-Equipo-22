[Summary]:Brazilian energy major Petrobras has loaded diesel from India on board a Suezmax crude oil tanker after a month-long delay, according to shiptracking data and trade sources, the first such shipment from India in more than a year amid volatile freight rates for clean product tankers.  The conversion of a crude oil tanker to carry clean products enabled Petrobras to ship bigger volumes of diesel from Asia at lower costs, with Asian sellers also seeking demand outlets outside this region, the sources said.  The larger shipments will likely ease downward pressure on an oversupplied Asian diesel market and create a price floor for the current market, the sources said.
