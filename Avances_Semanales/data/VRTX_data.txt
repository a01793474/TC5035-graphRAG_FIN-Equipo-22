[Headline]:US STOCKS-Futures slip as rate-cut hopes ebb
[Summary]:U.S. stock index futures dipped on Thursday as Treasury yields remained elevated a day after a hot inflation reading triggered a bruising Wall Street sell-off, diminishing hopes of a June rate cut by the Federal Reserve.  Wall Street sold off sharply in the last session after data showed U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected in March, leading financial markets to deduce that the central bank might delay cutting interest rates until September this year.  Further fueling concerns, minutes of the central bank's March meeting showed officials were worried that progress on inflation could have stalled and a longer period of tight monetary policy might be needed to tame the pace of price increases.
