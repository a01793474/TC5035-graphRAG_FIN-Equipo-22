[Headline]:The tech giants to benefit from AI bullishness: Strategist
[Summary]:Chip company Arm Holdings' (ARM) disappointing 2025 forecast could be signaling slowdowns in AI demands. Big Tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have all announced major investments in building out their AI infrastructures. While the plans show confidence in the future, will they actually pay off? Bokeh Capital Partners Founder and Chief Investment Officer Kimberly Forrest joins Morning Brief to give insight into the AI sector and discuss which companies are in the best position to actually benefit from AI investments. When asked about when investors will see real payoffs from these big investments from AI, Forrest says: "Building out the data center is part of it, then you're going to have companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), and everybody else is going to pile in and start using the generative AI to maybe increase productivity... And I would look for who do you think is most likely to benefit from using generative AI. And we've just mentioned them, right? Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, and to me Microsoft is really probably [in] the best position because they'll get people to actually pay for it, not just advertising dollars."

[Headline]:Arm shares fall as tepid forecast takes shine off AI optimism
[Summary]:Bets that Arm will benefit from a surge in AI computing have nearly doubled the chipmaker's share price since its initial public offer last September, giving it a market value of more than $100 billion.  "This is a typical case of ARM not being able to live up to heightened expectations," said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, adding that Arm's business is overtly reliant on the smartphone market, which has recently shown slower growth.  UK-based Arm, which earns by licensing its chip designs and through royalties, has been expanding into the data center market where operators are looking to build their own chips to power new AI models and reduce their reliance on dominant supplier Nvidia.

[Summary]:As company earnings continue to beat Wall Street expectations, US Equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) are rising from April lows. The market has also begun to price in the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping higher interest rates for longer, but is there more for investors to consider for the next few months? Horizon Investments Chief Investment Officer Scott Ladner and Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods join Market Domination to provide insight into navigating the market during the current economic environment. Ladner argues that the market needs a new catalyst. In the absence of any large upcoming catalyst, investors may be staring down a more challenging few months: "We could actually have some, some positive catalysts from the geopolitical standpoint. But I don't see anything huge on the horizon, frankly. I mean, I think this is gonna be a bit of a grinder, probably a little bit grinder for the next few months, but grinding up rather than down. " Woods questions how far earnings can carry the market: "Individual earnings, they're not enough to take that next leg higher. Amazon (AMZN) made a new high today. It's on the verge of a major breakout. If you look at it on a weekly chart, it hasn't taken us there. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), did, Microsoft (MSFT) didn't on solid earnings. So we're not seeing that euphoria. We're not seeing that tailwind we want to see. " For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
