This scenario could compel the central bank to hold rates steady and refrain from implementing rate cuts. While Peters acknowledges the potential for a rate hike, he notes that \"it's not the base case.\" The \"root cause\" of the Fed's rate-cut apprehension is \"a positive story,\" Peters says.

Google came out after that, and remember, Meta went down 11%, and Google initiated a dividend, which was great, but if you look at the forward numbers, actually, the estimates across the Street actually edged down for revenues for their upcoming June quarter as well. So, I think to some extent, Google benefitted from Meta going first, and if you look at Microsoft, sort of a similar situation, where the stock was up, I think, 2% or so the next day, but again, they came after Meta, and Microsoft's forward revenue numbers edged down slightly as well,\" Niles explained.
