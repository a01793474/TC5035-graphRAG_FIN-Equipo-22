WestEnd Capital Management Senior Equity Analyst Ali Mogharabi joins Market Domination to break down Uber's earnings and what it could signal for the company's future.

"The network effect of this entire platform continues to strengthen," he adds, citing increasing user growth and frequency. Mogharabi adds that Uber stock's dip is an "overreaction to a slight miss on mainly the bottom line, which was basically a decline in the unrealized value of the equity investments that these guys have."

[Summary]:Lyft, Inc. (LYFT) beat first-quarter earnings estimates, reporting $1.28 billion in revenue, and pushing the stock higher in extended trading hours. D.A. Davidson Senior Research Analyst Tom White sits down with Market Domination Overtime to discuss the ride-hail company's latest earnings figures, as well as its growth in gross bookings and active rider counts. "We're seeing Lyft kind of recapture some share, part of that is due to some lower pricing that David Risher, the CEO, kind of implemented when he assumed the reins," White explains. "We're just trying to get a sense of whether or not these share gains are really sustainable or is this just kind of an inevitable kind of bit of recovery from a relatively depressed level of category share, and it's going to be hard for them to kind of meaningfully get to where they were, maybe pre-pandemic."

[Summary]:Self-driving technology company Motional said on Tuesday it will pause robotaxi deployments with ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies and Lyft, while it lays off staff as part of its restructuring process to focus on technology development.  The development comes ahead of electric carmaker Tesla's unveiling of its robotaxi, dubbed "Cybercab", on Aug. 8 and as legacy automakers limit spending on expensive autonomous driving technology in the face of regulatory and safety hurdles.  Motional said it has completed more than 100,000 autonomous rides in Las Vegas and food deliveries in Los Angeles.

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court justices expressed concern, during oral arguments in Boston, over parts of an industry-supported group's proposal to ask voters to affirm that under state law, drivers are independent contractors with some new benefits but cannot be considered company employees.  Jennifer Grace Miller, a lawyer for the measure's opponents, said voters would be asked to weigh in on not one policy question but a series of separate areas of employment law that could not legally be bundled together for their consideration.

[Headline]:Are robots the future of food delivery? Serve Robotics thinks so
[Summary]:Your next late-night pizza delivery may be handed to you by a different kind of delivery driver: a four-wheeled autonomous robot. Food delivery bots have already taken to the streets of Los Angeles, treading sidewalks for several years already as Serve Robotics (SERV) has partnered with online food giant Uber Eats (UBER) for local deliveries. Serve Robotics CEO Ali Kashani joins Yahoo Finance in-studio to show off Serve's delivery robots and discuss how the company's autonomous bots are changing the future of food delivery services. "The first thing to keep in mind is that by default these robots are allowed to operate anywhere, but 20-plus states have put reservations in favor to encourage to launch the robots there. And fundamentally, one robot has 3,000 times less kinetic energy than a vehicle. So regulators understand that this makes roads safer," Kashani explains. "Now, we know for a fact this is safer than a car doing the same thing, but it has the advantage of reducing congestion and C02s, and also bringing the costs down for the local businesses that right now are struggling with the costs of delivery."
