[Headline]:Buy Northrop Grumman instead of Boeing: Portfolio manager
[Summary]:When investing, it can be hard to choose which stocks to avoid and which to consider, especially when you are trying to gain exposure to a specific sector. In the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, F/m Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Don Nesbitt shares his stock that could fly and which could face turbulence in the aerospace industry.  Nesbitt likes Northrop Grumman (NOC) for its "consistent earnings and sales growth." He also says the company has a strong order backlog and uses free cash flow to return cash to shareholders. He also thinks it has an attractive valuation. Nesbitt cautions, however, that the company risks facing an over-reliance on US government contracts.  Nesbitt is less of a fan of Boeing (BA). His first concern, which is a short-term one, is the uncertainty surrounding who will be leading the company after CEO Dave Calhoun steps down at the end of the year. Nesbitt also points to the debt downgrade from Moody's and the lack of a dividend. What could reverse his thesis? Investors shrugging off some of the more near-term concerns or that the leadership shake-up serves as a positive catalyst.
