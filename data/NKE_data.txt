[Headline]:How NFL’s Troy Vincent balances the game’s thrill and safety
[Summary]:The National Football League needs no introduction. Thanks to high-stake media deals and a big push into building a global fanbase, the NFL has built the world’s largest sports league — valued at $163 billion across its 32 teams, according to Forbes. Its lead in the industry is no accident. It’s the result of careful business branding, exclusive sponsorships, expanding the interests of an already massive audience, and adjusting to the changing landscape of the sport. In the 2023-24 season alone, the NFL partnered with 48 brands, holding top deals with EA Sports (EA), Nike (NKE) and Verizon (VZ), while generating over $11 billion from broadcasters, including Peacock, Amazon (AMZN), and ESPN, according to GlobalData. The 2024 Super Bowl also became the most-watched television program in US history. However, the NFL wouldn't exist, much less be the powerhouse it is today, without the league’s nearly 1,700 players. Troy Vincent is the one who is looking out for them on the field. As Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Vincent heads player development and oversees new and, at times, risky rules to a game loved and watched by millions, with one goal in mind — building on the success of the NFL through investing in its players.Before joining the C-suite, Vincent got his start in the NFL with the Miami Dolphins as a rookie cornerback in 1992. But NFL fans know him best from his time playing for the Philadelphia Eagles, where ​​he made five consecutive Pro Bowls. Yahoo Finance’s Josh Lipton visits the NFL headquarters and is later invited to Vincent’s family home in Purcellville, Virginia to get a closer look at the forces driving Vincent’s leadership and the business behind ‘America’s sport.’ For more on our Lead This Way Series, click here, and tune in to Yahoo Finance every Thursday.
