In addition, luxury athleisure brand Lululemon (LULU), which gained popularity among younger shoppers in the past, now has seen a bit of a decline in teen interest. Piper Sandler cited this trend in its decision to cut its price target on Lululemon stock from $525 to $470. Piper Sandler VP and Senior Research Analyst Abbie Zvejnieks joins Yahoo Finance to break down some of the highlights of the survey with athletic wear and the investment bank's outlook for Lululemon's North American growth outlook.
