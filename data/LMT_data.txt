[Headline]:An inside look at one company driving the new space economy
[Summary]:NASA has been a leader of space exploration for decades, being the only organization to put humans on the moon. As part of their Artemis missions, for the first time in over 50 years, NASA hopes to repeat that feat and put a human on the moon in 2026. One of the biggest differences this time: the private sector is helping them do it. In addition to major companies, like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), one of the businesses assisting in NASA’s mission is SpaceX. The private company, co-founded by Elon Musk, introduced a new commercial era of space exploration. In 2023 SpaceX executed 96 successful missions, launching a rocket on average every four days. There are many companies following SpaceX’s lead. Yahoo Finance got an inside look at one of those businesses: Firefly Aerospace. Firefly is also playing a role in NASA’s mission as part of the $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative, aimed at developing reliable transportation options to the moon for supplies and research. Later this year, Firefly will be the third American company to attempt an unmanned lunar landing with their Blue Ghost spacecraft. That mission is backed by a $112 million contract from NASA. While Firefly plans to continue its work with NASA, the company is expecting the commercial side of space to become a larger part of its business, with the industry expected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035, according to the World Economic Forum. In an effort to capitalize on this, and maximize speed and cost efficiency, Firefly’s mission is to become an end-to-end space transportation company. The company is manufacturing rockets, including an upcoming medium launch vehicle in partnership with Northrop Grumman (NOC), orbital vehicles to service spacecraft on their missions, and landers, like Blue Ghost. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.

[Headline]:Boeing's problems are good for GE Aerospace: Analyst explains
[Summary]:GE Aerospace (GE) has reported its first quarterly results since becoming an independent company after its spin-off from General Electric. The aerospace developer raised its 2024 profit forecast, buoyed by strong sales for jet engine parts and services. GE Aerospace shares are boosted in Tuesday's trading session after topping first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates. Argus Research President John Eade joins the Morning Brief to provide insights into GE Aerospace's performance. Eade describes the current period as "a good time right now for GE Aerospace" citing multiple tailwinds in the aviation industry — namely Boeing's (BA) production backlog and assembly concerns — coupled with the company's outstanding quarterly report, painting "a great story" for its future. Eade highlights that the separation into an independent entity allowed investors to "capture value" that was previously missing under GE's original broad business model. Shifting his focus to Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eade mentions that the aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor lacks "commercial exposure" and cannot grow as rapidly as GE Aerospace "despite the good news out of Washington" surrounding potential foreign aid packages to Israel and Ukraine. Eade ultimately recommends Lockheed Martin to investors looking for value. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.
