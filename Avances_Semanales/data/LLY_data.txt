[Summary]:Tuesday, Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY) reported first-quarter revenue of $8.77 billion, up 26% year over year, marginally missing the consensus of $8.92 billion, driven by increases of 16% in volume and 10% due to higher realized prices.

[Summary]:Wall Street's main indexes fell on Tuesday with caution prevailing ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision and as stronger-than-expected labor costs hinted at persistent inflation.  U.S. labor costs increased in the first quarter amid a rise in wages and benefits, confirming the surge in inflation early in the year that will likely delay a much-anticipated interest rate cut later in 2024.  The data comes ahead of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's (FOMC) two-day meeting during the day, with the interest rate verdict and Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the end of the event in focus.

[Headline]:Eli Lilly stock jumps on weight-loss drug sales forecast
[Summary]:Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) are moving higher on Tuesday morning as the company reported its first-quarter earnings results, revealing a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in a figure of $8.77 billion. Ultimately, this revenue print fell short of estimates ($8.92 billion). The pharmaceutical giant did, however, raise its annual sales forecast by $2 billion due to an insatiable demand for its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.

[Headline]:Eli Lilly's GLP-1 demand drives up stock price post Q1 results
[Summary]:Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) are soaring in Tuesday's trading session after the company raised its full-year guidance, driven by the surging demand for its offerings. BMO Capital Markets BioPharma Equity Research Managing Director Evan Seigerman joins the Morning Brief to discuss the stock's outlook. Seigerman notes that "demand is off the charts" for the company, and the raised guidance supports the bullish outlook. Despite missing on revenue, the company beat profit expectations, bolstering Seigerman's optimism about the stock's future performance. Addressing the competitive landscape Seigerman says it's "unlikely that any competitors are going to be out there in the next couple of years." Even if competitors enter the market, he believes Eli Lilly will continue advancing, giving them a distinct advantage. Seigerman highlights that the company is becoming "more and more efficient," opening additional facilities to support the surging demand. However, he notes that demand is through the roof, making it challenging to keep up. The analyst adds that his price target for the company is $900, but the stock's performance will be "driven by how quickly they can ramp up supply because the demand is there."
