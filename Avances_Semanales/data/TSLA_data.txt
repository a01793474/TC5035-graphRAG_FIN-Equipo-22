[Headline]:Making sense of Tesla's Supercharger, autonomous strategies
[Summary]:Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has big plans to expand the EV maker's Supercharger network by investing over $500 million into the project, according to a recent post on X. The irony lies in the fact that Tesla laid off a bulk of its Supercharger development team at the end of April. Gartner Vice President and Team Manager of Automotives, Transportation, and Cross Manufacturing Mike Ramsey sits down with Catalysts to discuss Tesla's charging network strategy, calling the layoffs a "cost optimization effort as they try to get their operations in line" "But, the investment in the network actually makes a lot of sense, and might be a real benefit to them in the long term as a new source of revenue," Ramsey tells Yahoo Finance. Ramsey goes on to comment on Tesla's full self-driving capabilities in its vehicles; Tesla's Autopilot function is currently undergoing a probe by Department of Justice (DOJ) officials. "What they're charging customers for is a partially automated system that is more like a convenience feature. It is not a self-driving vehicle, like something that Waymo is offering in the southeast United States and in San Francisco," Ramsey states. "So when Tesla talks about this service improving and rolling out, they are not really playing in the same field as many of the, I would say, fully autonomous robocab-type providers are playing. That said, their system keeps getting better and better and they can make money selling it because it's a nice feature and that people like to have, and... Tesla has promised that in August they're going to unveil their new robocab that can... essentially be a full self-driving vehicle. My expectation is that vehicle will not be the same thing that you and I can buy..." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

[Summary]:Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are under pressure as the Justice Department investigates whether Tesla committed wire and securities fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles' self-driving capabilities, Reuters reports. Barclays Senior Autos Analyst Dan Levy joins Catalysts to give insight into Tesla and the pressure the company is under as uncertainty grows around it. Levy explains why Tesla is headed down an uncertain path: "You have an investment thesis that's in pivot. And I think that there is uncertainty because the stock or the narrative is pivoting away from what was viewed as some certainty around vehicle sales, leveraging a cost advantage, and instead leveraging bets that people view as possibly binary. The push to autonomous, the push to robotaxi — these could be potentially largely disruptive bets, but they're binary. People just don't know what the outcome is."
