[Headline]:Can Sony, Apollo sell CBS if they do acquire Paramount?
[Summary]:Paramount (PARA, PARAA) is in deal talks with Sony (SONY) and Apollo Global (APO), but should the potential suitors acquire the media giant, they have plans to break it up and sell off the CBS network. To shed light on this development, Bank of America Securities Senior US Media and Entertainment Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich joins Catalysts. Ehrlich notes that Sony "can't own" CBS due to foreign ownership rules. However, Ehrlich highlights that if the transaction were to proceed, two questions would arise: Who can afford to own CBS and who can even own CBS "from a legal perspective"? Note: Apollo Global Management is a majority owner of Yahoo, Yahoo Finance's parent company. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

[Headline]:Warner Bros. Discovery history: Beyond the Ticker
[Summary]:Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) – a company with deep roots in the entertainment industry for over a century – was only formed a short two years ago. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into the media giant’s history, as it grapples with legacy media challenges and looks to build its streaming business into a serious industry player. 1923 Warner Brothers was founded on April 4, 1923, and quickly built itself into one of the Big Five American studios, alongside Universal Pictures (CMCSA), Paramount Pictures (PARA), Walt Disney Studios (DIS), and Sony Pictures (SONY). 1966 The Kinney National Company was formed. Its media division became Warner Communications. 1982-1985 Discovery was founded as the Cable Educational Network. The Discovery Channel launched soon after in 1985. 1990 Warner Communications was established as Time Warner, following a high-profile merger with Time Inc., that created the largest media company at the time. 1996 Time Warner purchased the Turner Broadcasting System in a $7.5 billion deal. That led to the acquisition of assets like HBO, Cinemax, Warner Bros. Studios, CNN, and Turner Sports. 2018 Time Warner was acquired by AT&T (T) for $85.4 billion. It was renamed WarnerMedia. 2022 The two companies officially merged after WarnerMedia was spun off by AT&T, joining forces with Discovery in a deal valued at $43 billion. Trading began on the Nasdaq on April 11, 2022, under the new ticker symbol WBD. Shares opened at $24.08 per share. 2023 The joint company’s first major project – the streaming launch of Max – offered content from Warner Bros., Discovery Channel, HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, Animal Planet, and more. But despite various profitability hurdles, Warner Bros. Discovery is still aiming for a top spot in the ever-evolving entertainment industry – with investors awaiting its next wave of innovation. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today. Check out more of our Beyond the Ticker series, and be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance. Editor's note: This video was produced by Zach Faulds.

[Summary]:Sony Pictures Entertainment (SONY) has entered talks with Apollo Global Management (APO), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, to discuss a possible joint buyout bid of Paramount Global (PARA,PARAA). According to the New York Times, both companies, through a joint venture, would offer cash for shares of Paramount, taking the company private. Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet joins The Morning Brief to discuss the potential joint buyout bid from Sony and Apollo and what it could mean for all companies involved and investors moving forward. In terms of what consumers can expect, should a deal go through, Bazinet says: "I think you'll see fewer apps...If this bid between Apollo and Sony is right, Sony is really sort of an arms dealer, right? So they're going to presumably take the studio and just feed everybody's app. Then I would think that someone on the private equity side would, sort of, not want to absorb the losses from a streaming app like Paramount+ and would just focus on the cash-generative assets and pay down debt to create equity value."
