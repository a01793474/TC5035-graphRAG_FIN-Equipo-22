[Headline]:Warner Bros. Discovery 'hopeful' for NBA deal
[Summary]:Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is reportedly at risk of losing NBA media rights to competitor NBCUniversal. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports more on the story and what it could mean for Warner Bros. Discovery's future. In the company's earnings call, CEO David Zaslav said, "We've enjoyed a strong partnership with the NBA for almost four decades. We're in continuing conversations with them now, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to reach an agreement that makes sense for both sides." NBCUniversal is reportedly willing to offer more than double what Warner Bros. Discovery currently pays for the rights. Zaslav added that the company is able to match third-party offers before the NBA enters into any agreements and is prepared for the potential outcomes that could result in the process. Warner Bros. Discovery is currently facing a decline in its linear networks, with advertising revenue falling 11% year-over-year in the quarter. The company could face detrimental outcomes if NBC outbids it for NBA rights. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Summary]:Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) will launch a new streaming service bundle including Disney+, Hulu, and Max in one package. The bundle is set to launch sometime in the summer and will mark the first cross-company partnership in streaming. CFRA Research Director of Equity Research Ken Leon and Third Bridge Sector Analyst Jamie Lumley join Market Domination to discuss the advent of a Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney partnership and how it can impact the streaming landscape. Lumley comments on Disney's profitability and search for growth with this deal: "They are now at profitability in their entertainment streaming segment... they are roughly on schedule for the profitability metrics they set out when they launched Disney+ back in 2019. But they're definitely scrambling for growth drivers here. If you look at the subscriber additions they had, there were 6 million core Disney+ subscribers added. But a lot of that is attributed to the Charter Communications (CHTR) deal, which was set up last year. And there could be some softness going forward." Leon offers this insight on the streaming landscape as a whole: "I think they're all de-risking. They're reducing capital, and they're going to say, 'gee, Netflix (NFLX) is a winner, large technology companies can play here. What can we do for two things?' One, try to grow subscribers, and two, try to get advertising revenue. So that's where bundle comes in. But it's only going to be maybe a number 3 or 4. There's going to be a lot of players that are really not going to make it in this game, because it's just not as attractive as before.

[Summary]:Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) – a company with deep roots in the entertainment industry for over a century – was only formed a short two years ago. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into the media giant’s history, as it grapples with legacy media challenges and looks to build its streaming business into a serious industry player. 1923 Warner Brothers was founded on April 4, 1923, and quickly built itself into one of the Big Five American studios, alongside Universal Pictures (CMCSA), Paramount Pictures (PARA), Walt Disney Studios (DIS), and Sony Pictures (SONY). 1966 The Kinney National Company was formed. Its media division became Warner Communications. 1982-1985 Discovery was founded as the Cable Educational Network. The Discovery Channel launched soon after in 1985. 1990 Warner Communications was established as Time Warner, following a high-profile merger with Time Inc., that created the largest media company at the time. 1996 Time Warner purchased the Turner Broadcasting System in a $7.5 billion deal. That led to the acquisition of assets like HBO, Cinemax, Warner Bros. Studios, CNN, and Turner Sports. 2018 Time Warner was acquired by AT&T (T) for $85.4 billion. It was renamed WarnerMedia. 2022 The two companies officially merged after WarnerMedia was spun off by AT&T, joining forces with Discovery in a deal valued at $43 billion. Trading began on the Nasdaq on April 11, 2022, under the new ticker symbol WBD. Shares opened at $24.08 per share. 2023 The joint company’s first major project – the streaming launch of Max – offered content from Warner Bros., Discovery Channel, HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, Animal Planet, and more. But despite various profitability hurdles, Warner Bros. Discovery is still aiming for a top spot in the ever-evolving entertainment industry – with investors awaiting its next wave of innovation. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

[Headline]:Nvidia earnings, geopolitics could offer needed market 'catalysts'
[Summary]:As company earnings continue to beat Wall Street expectations, US Equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) are rising from April lows. The market has also begun to price in the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping higher interest rates for longer, but is there more for investors to consider for the next few months? Horizon Investments Chief Investment Officer Scott Ladner and Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods join Market Domination to provide insight into navigating the market during the current economic environment. Ladner argues that the market needs a new catalyst. In the absence of any large upcoming catalyst, investors may be staring down a more challenging few months: "We could actually have some, some positive catalysts from the geopolitical standpoint. But I don't see anything huge on the horizon, frankly. I mean, I think this is gonna be a bit of a grinder, probably a little bit grinder for the next few months, but grinding up rather than down. " Woods questions how far earnings can carry the market: "Individual earnings, they're not enough to take that next leg higher. Amazon (AMZN) made a new high today. It's on the verge of a major breakout. If you look at it on a weekly chart, it hasn't taken us there. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), did, Microsoft (MSFT) didn't on solid earnings. So we're not seeing that euphoria. We're not seeing that tailwind we want to see. " For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Summary]:Despite weak parks and cruise guidance, Disney's (DIS) second quarter earnings saw its streaming services, Disney+ and Hulu, turn a profit for the first time. Blanke Schein Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Robert Schein joins Market Domination to break down the market reaction to the entertainment giant's earnings. Schein sees the sliding Disney stock as an overreaction stemming from Wall Street's disappointment in the company's weaker-than-expected guidance. Nonetheless, he stresses that Disney had a "solid" second quarter and is still trending higher year-to-date for long-term shareholders. Fresh off Disney's victory in a hotly contested proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz, Schein — who voted for Peltz — believes the situation ended in a "win-win."
