Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet joins The Morning Brief to discuss the potential joint buyout bid from Sony and Apollo and what it could mean for all companies involved and investors moving forward. In terms of what consumers can expect, should a deal go through, Bazinet says: \"I think you'll see fewer apps...If this bid between Apollo and Sony is right, Sony is really sort of an arms dealer, right? So they're going to presumably take the studio and just feed everybody's app. Then I would think that someone on the private equity side would, sort of, not want to absorb the losses from a streaming app like Paramount+ and would just focus on the cash-generative assets and pay down debt to create equity value.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.
