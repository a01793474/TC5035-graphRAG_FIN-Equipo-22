[Headline]:AI investments will help chip sector to recover: Analyst
[Summary]:The semiconductor sector is undergoing a correction as interest rate cut expectations dwindle, prompting concerns about the impact on these high-growth, technology-driven stocks. Wedbush Enterprise Hardware Analyst Matt Bryson joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the dynamics shaping the chip industry. Bryson acknowledges that the rise of generative AI has been a significant driving force behind the recent success of chip stocks. While he believes that AI is shifting "the way technology works," he notes it will take time. Due to this, Bryson highlights that "significant investment" will continue to occur in the chip market, fueled by the growth of generative AI applications. However, Bryson cautions that as interest rates remain elevated, it could "weigh on consumer spending." Nevertheless, he expresses confidence that the AI revolution "changing the landscape for tech" will likely insulate the sector from the effect of high interest rates, as investors are unwilling to miss out on the "next technology" breakthrough.

Moorhead notes "there's still this insatiable need" for semiconductor products, saying consumers "just can't get enough." He notes that oftentimes the products require a pairing across companies, so the demand is still there. While uncertainty persists around headwinds such as inflation and geopolitical tensions, he says this has forced investors to adopt "a wait-and-see attitude" in regard to the sector.
