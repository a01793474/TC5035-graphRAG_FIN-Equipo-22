[Summary]:AI has taken Wall Street by storm as many companies seek to incorporate the technology into their businesses. IBM (IBM) is no different, yet its technology might not be fully priced into its valuation, the tech giant's CEO suggests. Yahoo Finance Anchors Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita are joined by IBM CEO Arvind Krishna at the Annual Milken Global Institute Conference to explain why IBM's valuation may not be on par with other AI stocks. "We are building, we're staying in the right places that have credibility, we work with enterprise, hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum down the road. By the way, I don't think quantum or AI is fully priced into where we are, but I'll acknowledge that quantum is still three to five years out, and AI is kind of in its early innings," Krishna says.

[Summary]:IBM (IBM) like many other tech giants, have put considerable investments into AI. IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna spoke with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita at the Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss the company's performance, its investments in AI, and how the rest of the world views AI. Krishna speaks on AI regulation in the US: "I'm not concerned about the US falling behind. What I'm concerned about is that regulators should not regulate the technology. What regulators should regulate is the risk of the use cases. Can you imagine sitting back in 1995, let's regulate the internet, so lets regulate dial-up modems. How useful would that have been to today?" He continues with: "Don't regulate the technology. All you will do is it will go offshore, these are digital technologies, but regulate the use case, so we are sure it's being used responsibly. One that I also talk about, is make people who develop models accountable for what the models can do. I think those are tools that are classic policy tools and can be wonderfully applied."

The CEO compared the dangers of AI's potential misuse to that of nuclear weapons. IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna joins Yahoo Finance Anchors Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita at the Annual Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss why he disagrees with Warren Buffett's stance on AI. Krishna dismisses the danger: "I actually have no such fear. So I'm putting it black and white. I think there's a lot of people who hypothesize, and as you have seen in many technologies, thinking that the rate of progress which has been 100 times over the last 3, 4 years, is going to be another 100 to 1000 times. But just for the current AI, we need this much infrastructure and power for it to be 100 to 1000 times...I think it's a little fantastical to keep predicting that it carries on on an exponential curve."

[Headline]:IBM falls as enterprise-spending constraints choke consulting demand
[Summary]:Weakness in smaller discretionary projects affected the consulting segment, but analysts at J.P.Morgan said the backlog could help reaccelerate the business through 2024.  "Although software acceleration is encouraging, this was offset by more significant-than-expected deterioration of Consulting, along with incremental FX headwinds expected for the rest of the year," analysts at J.P.Morgan said.  IBM's software business grew 5.5% in the quarter and the company announced a $6.4 billion deal to buy cloud software company HashiCorp, aiming to make the most of an AI-led boom in demand for the data storage capabilities of the cloud.
