internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companiespatents and proprietary rightswe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our ip in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from february 2024 to august 2043 we have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our ip the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in asia, may not protect our products or ip rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:•the location in which our products are manufactured;•our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;•the degree to which ip laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and•the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regionswe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements9table of contentsgovernment regulationsour worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the united states as well as of foreign governmentsduring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the us government, or the usg, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to china (including hong kong and macau) and russia of our a100 and h100 integrated circuits, dgx or any other systems or boards which incorporate a100 or h100 integrated circuitsin july 2023, the usg informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of a100 and h100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the middle eastin october 2023, the usg announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to china and country groups d1, d4, and d5 (including but not limited to saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, and vietnam, but excluding israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including a100, a800, h100, h800, l4, l40, l40s and rtx 4090 the licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, country group d5, including china on october 23, 2023, the usg informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our a100, a800, h100, h800, and l40s productsour competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the usg’s export controls given the increasing strategic importance of ai and rising geopolitical tensions, the usg has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results in the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the china market, as well as other impacted markets, including the middle eastwhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the asia-pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business refer to “item 1a risk factors – risks related to regulatory, legal, our stock and other matters” for a discussion of this

and markets may adversely impact our financial resultsour accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry standardsour success depends on our ability to:•timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies;14table of contents•develop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;•launch new offerings with new business models including software,

and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance standards;•manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;•develop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations, customer support, e-commerce, ip licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and•complete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activitieswe have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all if we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand they also do not guarantee revenue failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations we cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners if we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmedwe have begun offering enterprise customers nvidia dgx cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying ai models, and nvidia ai foundations for customizable pretrained ai models we have partnered with csps to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities the timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines nvidia dgx cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment we also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including nvidia ai enterprise, nvidia omniverse, nvidia drive, and several other software solutions these new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services we may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offeringscompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial resultsour target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations our competitors’ products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this annual report on form 10-k, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling prices for our products some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive ip portfolios and patent protections, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing for example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our ai cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives if we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenuerisks related to demand, supply and manufacturingfailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demandwe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times we are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year if our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand this mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial resultswe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand while we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient 15table of contentscommitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change these risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties this risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy in periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended we have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months we have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so if our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits we may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declinesmany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:•changes in product development cycles and time to market;•competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;•changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;•the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;•new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;•new or unexpected end-use cases;•increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;•business decisions made by third parties;•the demand for accelerated or ai-related cloud services, including our own software and nvidia dgx cloud services;•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;•the demand for our products; or•government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usagedemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024 entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions we have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025 we have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements these increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk we may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components supply of hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong we expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications we may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declinesour customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our data center, professional visualization, and gaming products we will have a broader and faster data center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of ai opportunities the increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue we have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate 16table of contentstransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted the increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand while we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costsmany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple oems, odms, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners as a result, the decisions made by our multiple oems, odms, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream partiesif we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints if we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impactif we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments in the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions we have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future we have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future these impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products the risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply all of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial resultswe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as nvidia dgx cloud services, nvidia ai foundations, omniverse platform, llms, and generative ai models our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services recent technologies, such as generative ai models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for data center, the long-term trajectory is unknown because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative ai models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand additionally, we started shipping our cpu product offerings, the grace cpu and grace hopper superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 our ability to adequately predict our cpu demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levelschallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events in addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving taiwan and china, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on usthe use of our gpus other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand for example, several years ago, our gaming gpus began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as ethereum it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the ethereum 20 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining this has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our 17table of contentsgpus, which could negatively impact retail prices for our gpus and reduce demand for our new gpus in general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channelsadditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms we also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as geforce now failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demanddependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our businesswe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques we do not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors these subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products we face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:•lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;•failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;•failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;•limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers;•loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;•lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;•suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;•delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;•requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;•low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and•disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters and electricity conservation effortsdefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market shareour hardware and software product and service offerings are complex they have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released these risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production ai software products we or our partners offer rely on 18table of contentstraining data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by oems, odms, aibs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers an error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agenciesfor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain data center products this defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods these costs could be significant in future periods we recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect while we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect in general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial resultsrisks related to our global operating businessadverse economic conditions may harm our businesseconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on it infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:•increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;•increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;•decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;•the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;•limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;•the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties or other third parties we rely on;•reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and•increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments 19table of contentsadverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligationsadditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets, as described above a majority of our investment portfolio comprises usg securities a decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the usg credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the us dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions these factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment chargesinternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our businesswe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the united states our sales to china decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024 although we have not received licenses from the usg to ship restricted products to china, we have started to ship alternatives to the china market in small volumes china represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to usg licensing requirements and we expect china to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations these include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of ip and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic eventsproduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputationsecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measurescyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasibleindividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks additionally, some actors are using ai technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products we may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service providers certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms we have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services we may also incorporate third-party data into our ai algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms these datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents we may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our ai algorithms our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place in addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the 20table of contentspast and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security incident additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our businessto defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses we must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations while we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incidentwe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business for example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our gfn service breaches of our gfn security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose nvidia to potential litigation and liability if we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity in addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our businessbusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costsour worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to china, hong kong, israel, korea and taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability for example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the state of israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with israeli operations, including by economic boycotts our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues the ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations all of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results21table of contentswe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity we believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in israel accordingly, some of our employees in israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our businessadditionally, interruptions or delays in services from csps, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business as we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and servicesclimate change may have a long-term impact on our businessclimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in northern california may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our santa clara, california headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial conditionour business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits new or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm we may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals we may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costswe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns our business could be negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our gpus, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platformswe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our productswe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results if we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives if we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions in addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been 22table of contentsharmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive further, our investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment in addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives these companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return to the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses we face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiringadditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:•difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;•assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;•integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;•coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;•stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;•potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;•the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;•the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;•negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;•exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and•impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customersfor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel these challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the futurewe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network sales to one customer, customer a, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the compute & networking segment with several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors in the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple oems, odms, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners one indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through customer a, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the 23table of contentscompute & networking segment if end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue the loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to us or other countries’ trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operationsif we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmedto be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term successour business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, and internal controlswe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act the efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth we continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or erp, system any erp system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligationsidentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authoritiesour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could declineour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors therefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:•our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;•our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;•our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;•our vendors' payment requirements;•unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and•changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standardsany of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results for example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation these arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations in addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility24table of contentsrisks related to regulatory, legal, our stock and other mattersour operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our businesswe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting

suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business for example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks our position in markets relating to ai has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the european union, the united states, the united kingdom and china for example, the french competition authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets we have also received requests for information from regulators in the european union, the united kingdom, and china regarding our sales of gpus, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative ai if implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operationsgovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of us and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of us persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the us department of commerce’s us entity list or other usg restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business if we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the us or similar applicable non-us laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial conditionfor example, in response to the war in ukraine, the united states and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into russia, belarus, and certain regions of ukraine in fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to russia and closed business operations in russia concurrently, the war in ukraine has impacted sales in emea and may continue to do so in the futurethe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of ai technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating ai and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offeringsconcerns regarding third-party use of ai for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of ai applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying llms such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial resultssuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to ai technologies as geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with ai, including gpus and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the us and its allies the united states has imposed unilateral controls restricting gpus and associated 25table of contentsproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to china, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results export controls targeting gpus and semiconductors associated with ai, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results export controls targeting gpus and semiconductors associated with ai have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as nvidia ai cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside chinaexport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside china and for our gaming products the possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our businessincreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including china, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue regulators in china have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the china market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our mellanox acquisition if the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in china, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial conditionduring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the usg announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting china’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries these restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to china (including hong kong and macau) and russia, and specifically impact our a100 and h100 integrated circuits, dgx or any other systems or boards which incorporate a100 or h100 integrated circuits the licensing requirements also apply to any future nvidia integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip i/o performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits there are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in china during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the usg also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of a100 and h100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the middle eastin october 2023, the usg announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to china and country groups d1, d4, and d5 (including but not limited to, saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, and vietnam, but excluding israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including a100, a800, h100, h800, l4, l40, l40s and rtx 4090 the licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, country group d5, including china on october 23, 2023, the usg informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our a100, a800, h100, h800, and l40s products we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to chinafollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of china and hong kong any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the usg does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment to the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer however, the licensing process is time-consuming we have no assurance that the usg will grant such a license or that the usg will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept the usg is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review for example, the notified advanced computing, or “nac,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in china the license process for exports to d1 and d4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside china the requirements have a disproportionate impact on nvidia and already have disadvantaged and may in the future 26table of contentsdisadvantage nvidia against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their productsmanagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the usg’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the usg does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs even if the usg grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill the licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in china to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in china, europe, and israelgiven the increasing strategic importance of ai and rising geopolitical tensions, the usg has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results in the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the china market, as well as other impacted markets, including the middle east for example, the usg has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale gpu clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair gpus if certain system or use conditions are detected the usg has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming gpus, and if the usg expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside china, including the us and europe export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from hong kong export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter gpus may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our gpus the usg may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on nvidia and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside china and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain us semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than nvidia or other us firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results as a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in china, but also in other markets, such as europe, latin america, and southeast asia excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in us advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale at the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by us controlsadditionally, restrictions imposed by the chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our data center revenue the chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers for example, the chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by micron, a supplier of ours further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial resultsfinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in taiwan any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial resultsincreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with usshareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and government regulators have focused increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption further, there is an increasing number of state-level initiatives in the us that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, 27table of contentsregulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies these factors may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liabilityissues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including ai in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liabilityconcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as ai, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues we are increasingly building ai capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone ai applications ai poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as ai solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of ai models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to ai could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of ai, including in jurisdictions such as the european union as well as under any us regulation adopted in response to the biden administration’s executive order on ai, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements for example, regulation adopted in response to the executive order on ai could require us to notify the usg of certain safety test results and other information furthermore, changes in ai-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of ai by us or others could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harmactions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our productsfrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other ip rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnelwe may commence legal proceedings to protect our ip rights, which may increase our operating expenses we could be subject to countersuits as a result if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s ip, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s ip rights if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating resultswe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our ip foreign laws may not protect our products or ip rights to the same extent as united states law this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced we also may face risks to our ip if our employees are hired by competitors we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceablewe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations these areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liabilitywe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard 28table of contentsto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in ai, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results the theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claimsin the united states, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection in the past few years, numerous us states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data as applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making the exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments these state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance for example, the california consumer privacy act of 2018, as amended by the california privacy rights act of 2020, or cpra, or collectively the ccpa, gives california residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared the ccpa provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services if we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection the european union adopted the general data protection regulation, or gdpr, and the united kingdom similarly adopted the uk gdpr, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the european economic area, or eea, and the united kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves if we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data furthermore, the eu ai act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practicesin the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from europe, china, and other jurisdictions to the united states or other countries certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws for example, the gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the eea the european commission released a set of “standard contractual clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the eea to jurisdictions that the european commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the united states additionally, the uk’s international data transfer agreement / addendum, as well as the eu-us data privacy framework and the uk extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant us-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the framework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the eea and uk to the united states however, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the united states other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators for example, china’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization data broadly defined as important under china’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of china without prior assessment and approval by the cyberspace administration of china, or cac compliance with these requirements, including cac assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in china or impact our ability to transfer data outside of china the inability to import personal data to the united states could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to european, china and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense some european regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of europe for allegedly violating the gdpr’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our businesswe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant for example, certain privacy laws, such as the gdpr and the ccpa, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers we sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines we publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences29table of contentsdata protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices these obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with such obligations if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial conditionwe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factorswe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flowsfurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the us or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business most of our income is taxable in the united states, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or fdii if us tax rates increase or the fdii deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected in addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and pillar two model rules announced by the organization for economic cooperation and development, or oecd these and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial conditionour future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur a decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial resultsour business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedingswe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business for example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in 2017 and 2018 litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operationsour indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligationsas of january 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $97 billion in notes due by 2060 as each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes if we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition we also have a $575 million commercial paper programmaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our businessour ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared 30table of contentsimmediately due and payable changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict

in controlthe anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the

requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws under our agreement with microsoft for the xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock these

identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the iso 27001 international standard for information security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate we consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk management and strategyidentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threatswe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information we take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors we routinely assess our high-risk suppliers’ conformance to industry standards (eg, iso 27001, iso 28001, and c-tpat), and we evaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirementsrefer to “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about

overviewour company and our businessesnvidia pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems since our original focus on pc graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields nvidia has leveraged its gpu architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, ai solutions, scientific computing, data science, av, robotics, metaverse and 3d internet applicationsour two operating segments are "compute & networking" and "graphics" refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional informationheadquartered in santa clara, california, nvidia was incorporated in california in april 1993 and reincorporated in delaware in april 1998 recent developments, future objectives and challengesdemand and supply, product transitions, and new products and business modelsdemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024 entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions we have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025 we have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements these increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components we may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements supply of hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong we expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications we may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declineswe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand while we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change these risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexityproduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our data center, professional visualization, and gaming products we will have a broader and faster data center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of ai opportunities the increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue the increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand while we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costswe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our nvidia dgx cloud services, omniverse platform, llms, and generative ai models our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services recent technologies, such as generative ai models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for data center, the long-term trajectory is unknown34table of contentsglobal tradeduring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the usg, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to china (including hong kong and macau) and russia of our a100 and h100 integrated circuits, dgx or any other systems or boards which incorporate a100 or h100 integrated circuitsin july 2023, the usg informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of a100 and h100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the middle eastin october 2023, the usg announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to china and country groups d1, d4, and d5 (including but not limited to saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, and vietnam, but excluding israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including a100, a800, h100, h800, l4, l40, l40s and rtx 4090 the licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, country group d5, including china on october 23, 2023, the usg informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our a100, a800, h100, h800, and l40s products our sales to china decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to china we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the usg does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment we have started to ship alternatives to the china market in small volumes china represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to usg licensing requirements and we expect china to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 to the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the usg will grant such a license, or that the usg will act on the license application in a timely manner or at allour competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the usg’s export controls given the increasing strategic importance of ai and rising geopolitical tensions, the usg has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results in the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the china market, as well as other impacted markets, including the middle eastwhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the asia-pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business refer to “item 1a risk factors – risks related to regulatory, legal, our stock and other matters” for a discussion of this potential impactmacroeconomic factorsmacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products while difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors israel and hamas conflictwe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity we believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in israel accordingly, some of our employees in israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business35table of contentsfiscal year 2024 summary year ended jan 28, 2024jan 29, 2023change($ in millions, except per

consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of significant accounting policiesinventorieswe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgmentsituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventorythe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 27% in fiscal year 2024 and 75% in fiscal year 2023 our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand we account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity we also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our productsrefer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management's discussion and analysis for further discussionincome taxeswe are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyas of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $16 billion and $15 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the periodwe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense37table of contentsrevenue recognitionrevenue allowancesfor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates however, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments for shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstanceswe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factorslicense and development arrangementsrevenue from license and development arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicablecontracts with multiple performance obligationsour contracts may contain more than one performance obligation judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct except for license and development arrangements, nvidia products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposeswe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis in certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers if standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputschange in accounting estimatein february 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years the estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million

benefit, partially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 millionthe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the fdii deduction, stock-based compensation, and the us federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the irs audit resolutionour effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the fdii deduction, stock-based compensation and the us federal research tax credit our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the irs audit resolutionthe oecd has announced an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting including pillar two model rules for a new 15% global minimum tax applicable to large multinational corporations certain jurisdictions, including european union member states and the united kingdom, have enacted pillar two legislation that will start to become effective for our fiscal year 2025 the oecd, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation on pillar two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules based on enacted laws,

over financial reportinga company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statementsbecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes

from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relatesvaluation of inventories - provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitmentsas described in notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments most of the company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions as of january 28, 2024, the company’s consolidated inventories balance was $53 billion and the company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $161 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations the principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements these procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions these procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and

yearsprinciples of consolidationour consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nvidia corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidationuse of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from our estimates on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies these estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonablein february 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years the effect of this change for the fiscal year ended january 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $005 per both basic and diluted sharerevenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services we determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligationproduct sales revenuerevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customersfor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates however, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returnsour customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or mdfs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products we account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers55table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statements(continued)license and development arrangementsour license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our ip components as a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that periodsoftware licensingour software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performedcloud servicescloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support contracts with multiple performance obligationsour contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation we account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contractwe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis the standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers when determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs if a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is requiredproduct warrantieswe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware component failures cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimatedstock-based compensationwe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or rsus, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or psus we use a monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based psus the compensation expense for rsus and market-based psus is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or espp, using the black-scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock-based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally, for rsu, psu, and market-based psu awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experiencelitigation, investigation and settlement costswe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions 56table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statements(continued)or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costsforeign currency remeasurementwe use the us dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into united states dollars at end-of-period exchange rates non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our consolidated statements of income and to date have not been significantincome taxeswe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realizedour calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the us, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyas of january 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $16 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits

together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or

derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earningsconcentration of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of creditinventoriesinventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up we record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventoryproperty and equipmentproperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded the estimated useful lives of our buildings are up

exist in completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units the quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value the income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business intangible assets and other long-lived assetsintangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired ip we currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable the recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance

purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement the estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives these estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made as a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of incomeacquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurredinvestments in
