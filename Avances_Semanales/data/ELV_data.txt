[Headline]:Health stocks drop after Medicare Advantage rates disappoint
[Summary]:Healthcare stocks are under pressure Tuesday after Medicare Advantage plan payments for 2025 came in lower than expected. TD Cowen Senior Equity Research Analyst at Gary Taylor joins Yahoo Finance Live to explain the implications for the healthcare industry. Taylor describes it as an "annual political dance" that occurs between the industry and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). He explains that when a proposed rule is issued, such as the 2025 Medicare Advantage (MA) proposed rule, "generally the industry lobbies...to make a case" for higher proposed rates. Typically, the final notice reflects increased rates; however, this time, CMS did not make any adjustments. Taylor states that the potential fallout could "drive the industry to reduce the benefits they're offering seniors" next year, which could bolster margins for these businesses. Coupled with the low rate for 2025, he says, this dynamic could result in higher earnings growth.
