What factors may create more complexity and execution risk for NVIDIA?,"Increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into NVIDIA's supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk.",nvda-20240128/1A.txt
What challenges may arise due to product transitions for NVIDIA?,"Product transitions are complex and can impact NVIDIA's revenue as they often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and NVIDIA and its channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to NVIDIA's product introduction cycles, they are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of their Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays.",nvda-20240128/1A.txt
"What impact may the decisions made by multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners have on NVIDIA?","The decisions made by multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for NVIDIA's products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact NVIDIA's ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.",nvda-20240128/1A.txt
What risks does NVIDIA face if they underestimate their customers' future demand for their products?,"If NVIDIA underestimates their customers' future demand for their products, their foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and NVIDIA may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if NVIDIA is able to increase supply to meet customer demand, they may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or their contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If NVIDIA cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill their customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, their customer relationships could be damaged, they could lose revenue and market share and their reputation could be harmed.",nvda-20240128/1A.txt
What risks does NVIDIA face if they overestimate their customers' future demand for their products?,"If NVIDIA overestimates their customers' future demand for their products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from their competitors, they may not be able to reduce their inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, NVIDIA has experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that they have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of their overestimation of future demand, and they may need to continue these reductions. NVIDIA has had to increase prices for certain of their products as a result of their suppliers' increase in prices, and they may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. NVIDIA has also written down their inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by their placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of their historical lead times and could be exacerbated if they need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as their purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of their total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact NVIDIA's gross margins and financial results.",nvda-20240128/1A.txt
