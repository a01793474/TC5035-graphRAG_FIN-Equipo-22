RBC Capital Markets Analyst Chris Dendrinos joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his bullish initiation of coverage on GE Vernova, rating the stock as Outperform with a $160 price target. Dendrinos explains that with \"multi-national conglomerate[s],\" funds are often invested in certain parts of the business while others remain underinvested. With General Electric's company splitting into standalone businesses, he believes all investments for GE Vernova will be directed into the energy business, boosting transformation efforts.

Dendrinos highlights that GE Vernova has a \"multi-year pathway\" to financial improvement, emphasizing that it will be a long-term effort to reach normalization. Nevertheless, he believes the company will eventually achieve the desired free cash flow, which should boost the stock's valuation.

GE Aerospace shares are boosted in Tuesday's trading session after topping first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates. Argus Research President John Eade joins the Morning Brief to provide insights into GE Aerospace's performance. Eade describes the current period as \"a good time right now for GE Aerospace\" citing multiple tailwinds in the aviation industry \u2014 namely Boeing's (BA) production backlog and assembly concerns \u2014 coupled with the company's outstanding quarterly report, painting \"a great story\" for its future. Eade highlights that the separation into an independent entity allowed investors to \"capture value\" that was previously missing under GE's original broad business model. Shifting his focus to Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eade mentions that the aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor lacks \"commercial exposure\" and cannot grow as rapidly as GE Aerospace \"despite the good news out of Washington\" surrounding potential foreign aid packages to Israel and Ukraine. Eade ultimately recommends Lockheed Martin to investors looking for value. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.
