Value stocks have been out of favor for the last few years, but value investor John Bailer, Newton Investment Management Deputy Head of Equity Income and Portfolio Manager, thinks that is going to change. Bailer believes that the decade following the 2008 financial crisis was an \"anomaly\" rather than the norm given how low rates had to be to spur economic growth. He says that rates have tended to skew, historically, to 4%-5% and, in that environment, value stocks tend to be what works. \"I do think that, for lots of reasons, we're going to have a little more inflation, a little higher interest rates. Money isn't going to be free any longer. And value will come back into favor,\" Bailer claims. Watch the video above to hear why Bailer says JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is a value stock to consider.
